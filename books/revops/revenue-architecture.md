To Maureen, the love of my life,
We are like two trees, each standing tall and independent. 
Our roots dig deep, anchoring us with stability, while our 
branches stretch upward toward the light. As the seasons 
of life ebb and ﬂow, our branches increasingly ﬁnd 
themselves entwined, and our leaves whisper secrets 
carried by the wind.
Though we started as two individual trees, we've each given 
a little and leaned in, creating a single, magniﬁcent canopy 
together. Beneath it, we've raised a family, offered shelter to 
loved ones, and opened our arms to those in need. We've 
weathered many storms and basked in abundant sunshine, 
each event leaving a ring in our trunks and adding a chapter 
to our story.
In the grand forest of life, we're often seen as a single tree, 
stronger together than we ever could have been apart.

The launch of a recurring revenue business and its journey to become a 
public company are often likened to a rocket launching into space to explore 
new worlds. 
Imagine sitting in the capsule of that rocket, eyes gleaming with excitement, 
feeling the adrenaline rush through your body as you prepare to break speed 
barriers with hopes of reaching the stars. This is what it feels like to launch a 
company, and this sense of triumph extends far beyond the company’s 
founders. For those who have been part of a successful launch, across all 
roles in the organization, these moments stand out as some of their 
proudest achievements.
But there are dangers lurking underneath; there are fears that few speak about. 
When famed astronaut John Glenn was asked, "When you are sitting in that 
capsule listening to the countdown, how do you feel?" He responded, “I felt 
exactly how you would feel if you were getting ready to launch and knew you 
were sitting on top of two million parts—all built by the lowest bidder on a 
government contract.”
Today, being part of a hypergrowth Startup feels much the same: sitting atop a 
highly explosive recurring revenue engine that requires thousands of individual 
actions to work seamlessly together, dependent on ﬂawless execution by people 
who may lack formal education or practical experience in the subject.

To no one's surprise, this results in fewer than 2% of venture funded companies 
reaching their destinations. I believe we can do better. Much better. This book 
aspires to double or even quadruple that success rate.
How? By applying the same engineering-like approach used to build rockets, 
to construct bridges, and to guide medical procedures. An approach rooted 
in extensive research, proven scientiﬁc principles, modeled on practical 
experiences, executed through processes, and implemented in systems. 
This book is not meant to provide mere answers. As Carl Sagan once said, 
"Science is more than a body of knowledge. It's a way of thinking." This book 
is meant to do just that. And with it, open up a new world of possibilities.
I refuse to believe that our greatest accomplishments in the ﬁeld of Go To 
Market lie behind us. Especially with the rise of AI. It feels like we're standing 
on the precipice of a new age, and an exciting era awaits. Yes, there are many 
threats, but there are even more exhilarating opportunities. So with a gleam 
in our eye, let's step into this new and wonderful world of scientiﬁc 
growth together.
All Systems Go!

Built nearly a century ago, the Golden Gate Bridge was a pioneering marvel, and 
it remained the longest and tallest suspension bridge in the world for nearly 30 
years. How do you build a bridge longer and taller than any bridge ever built? 
And how do you get it to withstand a century of wind, waves, and earthquakes? 
The answer lies in meticulous planning, precise design, adherence to scientiﬁc 
principles, and innovative engineering.  The engineers and architects behind it 
recognized the signiﬁcance of a solid foundation based on observation and 
scientiﬁc knowledge. I have the privilege of frequently driving across the Golden 
Gate Bridge, and each time, I am in awe of its vast span. 
Based on its location in Silicon Valley and funded by gains from the days of 
gold mining, I can't help but draw parallels between the bridge and the world of 
recurring revenue. When the bridge was built, it was based on the latest 
scientiﬁc advances. I ﬁrmly believe we can apply many of the same scientiﬁc 
principles that guided the construction of this iconic bridge to the realm of 
building scalable and sustainable recurring revenue businesses. However, to 
do so, we must embrace a scientiﬁc approach, which means we must base 
our strategies and decisions on evidence, data, and practical experience. 
Over the past decade, I have collaborated closely with over a thousand 
companies, gaining ﬁrst-hand insight into their growth. These experiences have 
left me with a compelling vision of the future, where subscription-based 
services illuminate the path to a more customer-centric approach to sales.

It is clear to me that we are at a crossroads in the world, transitioning from 
old to new ways, spurred by the advancements of Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI). 
This new approach must be scalable, sustainable, and durable to meet the 
demands of an ever evolving business landscape.
A recurring revenue SaaS business is like a factory made up of GTM motions 
acting like production lines, each made up of modular components. Just as    the 
modular components of a bridge are designed independently and then 
assembled to span a gap, each of the components in a revenue factory is 
optimized independently and brought together functionally to produce revenue in 
a number of GTM motions. All individuals who work in a revenue factory  come 
together to form the Go-To-Market (GTM) team. The GTM team aims      to 
achieve 3 core goals: driving (revenue) growth, optimizing operational costs, and 
improving product quality. The exact same goals as that of a factory.
Historically, two critical elements have been missing to help the GTM team 
achieve these goals: an Operating Model to run the factory eﬃciently, and a 
detailed growth design. Revenue Architecture is a discipline encompassing     the 
collective knowledge of all GTM functions. Its outcome is the blueprint for the 
Operating Model, laying the foundation for sustainable growth. In today's 
hypergrowth Scaleups, each team member must grasp the fundamental 
principles of growing a recurring revenue operation. Learning from the abuses 
and issues we have witnessed during the decade that preceded the 2022 SaaS 
crash, executive education on this subject is an absolute requirement.
This book serves as a guiding light, illuminating a lifetime of lessons learned and 
synthesizing a new path forward. It is a work in progress, in which you play an 
essential role as the reader. Your contribution and continuing exploration  are 
vital to shaping the future of successful scaling. So, as we bid farewell to   an 
exciting decade, let us appreciate the achievements that have brought us this 
far. However, let us also acknowledge that the strategies and methods   that 
propelled us in the past will no longer be enough to carry us forward. 
Join me on this transformative journey as we embark on a scientiﬁc approach  
to scaling up. Together we can build beautiful businesses that, like the Golden 
Gate Bridge, stand the test of time, and leave us in awe.

A few years ago, we witnessed one of the most remarkable human-made 
wonders ever. Nearly all of humankind came to depend on it overnight. Yet,  
even today, few can pinpoint what it was, as it was obscured by the events 
that followed. This book not only unveils the source code behind this modern 
marvel but also provides the blueprint to recreate its magic.
In 2020, the world faced a crisis of monumental proportions: a global pandemic. 
Almost overnight, remote work became not the exception, but the rule. Billions 
relied on their phones, tablets, and computers to navigate the intricacies of   daily 
life—to work, communicate with family, participate in their communities, and go to 
school. At some point during the pandemic, nearly everyone on earth    who had a 
smartphone installed a product like Zoom, hosted on a ubiquitous infrastructure 
known as “the cloud.” The technology deployed on an unprecedented scale, and 
against all odds, it worked ﬂawlessly. Students and teachers, schools and 
governments—everyone found themselves relying on the cloud.
Amid the chaos and upheaval of a global pandemic, a quiet wonder had 
occurred—one that many of us took for granted, even while it underpinned  
nearly every facet of our lives: the cloud had come to our rescue. This wonder 
didn’t just suddenly appear; it came about through decades of incremental 
advancements in global infrastructure and cloud software that allowed the cloud 
to embrace the moment. The term “the cloud” sounds ﬂuffy, but there is much 
more to it than its nebulous name suggests.

The cloud came to exist in its current form because it was heavily inﬂuenced by 
the following:
1. The Internet: The triumph of SaaS, or Software as a Service, in 2020 was 
rooted in an intricate web of interconnected servers and computing power 
built over the previous 30 years. This offered extensive, seamless, and 
ubiquitous access to the cloud regardless of geographical location.
2. Smartphones: Devices permeate every aspect of our lives. With over 6.5 
billion smartphones in the market, approximately 2 out of every 3 individuals 
had direct access to the cloud infrastructure.
3. A Diverse Landscape of Applications: With many applications available, 
virtually every need could be catered to. Communication apps such as Zoom 
(see Figure 1.1) gained immense popularity, fostering seamless connections 
between people regardless of their physical isolation.
These building blocks forged a highly reliable global infrastructure serving 
billions of users worldwide. Yet, one crucial building block has gone unnoticed:
4. Innovative Business Models: The industry embraced a novel business 
approach, enabling access to essential services through subscription- or 
usage-based fees on a recurring basis. The most popular use case is SaaS. 
This innovation facilitated ubiquitous access and enabled everyone with a 
smartphone to partake.
Before the pandemic, many industry experts doubted a cloud-based 
infrastructure could carry the performance needed for global Enterprise-grade 
systems. However, the 2020 pandemic proved them wrong. Overnight, every 
business, government, and educational institution worldwide became dependent 
on cloud products and experienced the beneﬁts of a subscription-based 
approach using a recurring revenue model. In the summer of 2020, we pinched 
ourselves, for we had all witnessed a wonder: during the pandemic, the entire 
world had become dependent on subscription- and consumption-based services 
overnight, and it did so without a hitch. It felt as if SaaS products and their novel 
pay structures had just saved the world.

Next, we will dissect the factors behind the rapid growth and the subsequent 
market crash, analyzing its underlying causes, in Section 1.1 The Golden Era. 
This exploration will help set the stage for where we are headed next and how to 
get there, introducing 3 key concepts:
● Section 1.2  The Revenue Factory: We'll delve into the Factory concept, 
which offers a blueprint for sustainable growth and operational eﬃciency in 
recurring revenue businesses.
● Section 1.3  The Go-To-Market (GTM) Approach: Moving away from the 
siloed operation, we'll explore a GTM approach where revenue is generated 
through a uniﬁed organizational effort akin to a factory's production line.
● Section 1.4  Phase Shifting: An examination of how recurring revenue 
businesses undergo several fundamental changes quickly, a concept known 
as Phase Shifts. The focus will be on managing through these numerous 
phase shifts smoothly, which most management teams are unfamiliar with.
Collectively, they do not just narrate a shift in strategic thinking; they propel us 
into an exciting future and act as tools to navigate the modern economic 
landscape's ever-changing landscape.

$
SaaS is a versatile term that encompasses various aspects of the software 
delivery model. It plays a pivotal role in modern technology, and its usage 
can be classiﬁed into 3 categories:
● SaaS as a Delivery Model: Refers to cloud-hosted applications 
accessed via the internet through subscription-based services. Users 
lease the software instead of owning it outright. The advantages 
include accessibility from any internet connection and regular software 
updates and maintenance without the hassle of manual installations.
● SaaS as a Business Model: Includes both subscription-based and 
consumption-based agreements. Subscription-based agreements 
specify the duration of software access, ranging from daily to annual 
terms, while consumption-based agreements detail the usage-based 
terms and pricing, aligning costs with the actual use of the software.
● SaaS as a Payment Structure: Encompasses recurring payments 
based on the terms outlined in a subscription contract. Recurring 
payments provide a more dependable and continuous stream of 
income, allowing for better resource allocation. Due to the need to 
provide ongoing results to retain customers, it naturally fosters 
long-term relationships with customers, making it customer-centric.
Throughout this document, we will limit the use of “SaaS” and instead refer 
to “Recurring Revenue,” indicating its use as a payment structure, or 
“Subscription” to reﬂect on it as a business model. This approach provides 
a clearer delineation of the multifaceted role of SaaS in the software 
industry.

THE GOLDEN ERA
While the number of subscription services were exploding and valuations were 
catapulting, underneath, a ﬁre was smoldering. Most of these companies were 
being built on a “growth-at-all-costs” mindset, and the sudden increase in 
usage made their structural and conceptual weaknesses more pronounced.  
To create more growth, more people were hired, and more attention was paid 
to short-term wins without applying short- or long-term ﬁnancial discipline. 
Unsurprisingly, this resulted in a steep increase in the cost of acquisitions. 
Meanwhile, companies went public with less revenue, relying on more 
immature marketing and sales motions. Surely this could not continue?  All this 
led to 2021, a year that marked a watershed era of success for the SaaS 
industry: 27 Initial Public Offerings (IPOs), and an astonishing 787 unicorns 
were minted, according to DealRoom. This surge was largely fueled by the 
continued growth-at-all-costs mindset.
The SaaS Crash
In 2021, after more than a decade of intense growth, signs of a coming 
transformation began to emerge. In November 2021, the SaaS stock market 
peaked. However, on December 3, 2021, the ﬁrst domino fell as the Wall Street 
Journal reported, "DocuSign Shares Fall More Than 40% as Customer Behavior 
Shifts." At the start of 2022, a casual observer might have judged everything to 
be ﬁne, but by then, geopolitics and other emerging challenges had begun to 
slow down the economy.
In February 2022, many marketing leaders noticed a sluggish lead ﬂow, and in 
the following months, sales leaders started to see deals being delayed. Naturally, 
booking performance fell short, and soon after, the growth rate began to decline, 
slowing down funding and delaying IPOs. With less money available to invest, 
the valuations of Startups dropped. Market reporter Rebecca Szkutak published 
an article on March 23, 2022, entitled "Record-Setting Venture Capital Market 
Shows Signs of a Slowdown.”

THE 
SAAS 
CRASH
 THE GOLDEN ERA.
The end of the Golden Era of SaaS had come. An era that began with Marc 
Andreessen's prescient words in 2011, "Why Software is Eating the World," 
crashed during the winter of 2022 and ended with an exclamation point with the 
collapse of Silicon Valley Bank on March 10, 2023. So, where do we go from 
here? To learn where we are going we must ﬁrst delve into the origins of this 
turmoil.
The new situation we ﬁnd ourselves in demands a new operational framework. 
But to do that, we have one important thing to do. We must ﬁrst identify the root 
cause of the crash to prevent it from ever happening again.
By early summer 2022, the situation had worsened, and venture ﬁrms started 
to recommend their portfolio companies cut costs by 20% across the board, 
while others advised surgically paring down expenses. However, it was too late; 
the damage was done. The SaaS market had crashed, marking the end of an 
11-year tech bull market that resulted in a historic 50% value destruction in 
public (and private) SaaS companies, with the average market cap down 57% 
from its 12-month highs. This massive reduction in market value impacted 
public SaaS companies and hit the entire tech ecosystem like a tidal wave.

What Caused the SaaS Crash?
The SaaS crash did not come as a surprise to everyone. Many industry experts 
had warned of the market’s unsustainability in the years leading up to this. 
However, the speed at which it happened and the widespread impact of the 
crash still caught many off guard. For far too long, the market had coasted on a 
diet of ﬁnancial junk food, propelled by cheap investment money warranted by 
occasional bursts of explosive growth in a particular sector.
Various factors contributed to this unprecedented fall, including rising interest 
rates, the end of the COVID inﬂation, macroeconomic risks, and geopolitical 
uncertainties like the war in Europe. While these events certainly played an 
important role and may have caused the situation to spill over, they were not its 
root causes. An average customer buying a license to sign electronic 
documents or to use communication software is typically disconnected from 
U.S. bond prices. And let's not forget that customers were still buying and 
feverishly using SaaS products when this occurred. So what was the cause? 
During the Golden Era of SaaS, the prolonged period of low interest rates led to 
abundant investor capital. It enabled SaaS investments to grow without regard 
to near-term proﬁtability, a Go-To-Market (GTM) approach that has since been 
coined “growth at all costs.” To ﬁnd the actual problem, let's analyze what the 
growth-at-all-costs GTM approach is.
The Growth-at-All-Costs Culture
During the Golden Era the market rewarded growth at SaaS companies with 
higher valuations. Entrepreneurs quickly realized that the faster the growth, 
the higher the valuation, thereby increasing the likelihood of going public. 
Investors themselves also favored this trend, as an investment made at a 
given valuation could swiftly be justiﬁed by the next investor willing to invest at 
multiple times that valuation. Ultimately, the public markets rewarded 
founders, allowing them to amass unimaginable wealth and helping investors 
achieve their Internal Rate of Return, or IRR, targets. It resulted in companies 
hiring unskilled labor, purchasing a myriad of tools, and applying unproven 
methods—all of which contributed to the soaring costs found on most SaaS 
companies' ﬁnancial statements.

C H A P T E R   0 1   |   I N T R O D U C T I O N
In practical terms, the quality of the customer experience was considered 
secondary to the growth rate. This approach compelled organizations to focus 
on seeking more revenue, leading to an emphasis on acquiring more deals and 
leads. Unfortunately, this relentless pursuit of more led to organizations using 
spam-like tactics and handing over control to the lowest-cost and least-skilled 
laborers who used the advances of email automation to SPAM prospects and 
customers. This GTM approach caused overall costs to skyrocket, resulting in a 
chaotic array of tools and methods. Consequently, departments operated 
ineffectively and ineﬃciently, pressuring companies to search for more leads to 
create more deals and generate more revenue. The growth-at-all-costs mentality 
fostered an "always do more" culture. It's important to note that the industry 
wasn't oblivious to these issues. 
As early as 2016, it became evident that the current growth tactics wouldn't be 
sustainable in the long run. In fact, by 2018, the industry recognized the 
necessity for a more cost-eﬃcient approach to growth and initiated efforts to 
address the situation. However, when the pandemic struck, these corrective 
initiatives were set aside. If anything, the pandemic further fueled the ﬂames of 
the growth-at-all-costs mindset, intensifying an already precarious situation.
Who's to Blame?
Although we may be quick to point ﬁngers at investors as the root of all this, 
such blame is unfair and inaccurate; entrepreneurs were equally at fault. A 
pattern had emerged: pursue growth at all costs, and receive higher and higher 
valuations. Investors could justify their investment, with each of these valuations 
doubling or tripling. Companies could get to the public market faster, where the 
founders and investors could take their chips off the table and become wealthy. 
Then, technology vendors such as email automation providers, service providers, 
and consultants came along to fan the ﬂames. Everyone was contributing to the 
hype. It was not the fault of a single party. It was an entire industry's doing, and it 
brought us to where we are today, with tens of thousands of SaaS companies 
sitting on a mature global infrastructure with over a billion users—not a bad 
place to be, and a fantastic foundation upon which to build.

The Road from Growth at All Costs Leads to Sustainable Growth
SaaS as an industry has undergone a signiﬁcant transformation over the last 
decade, marked by 4 distinct eras:
● In 2012, we witnessed a surge in growth fueled by low interest rates, 
fostering a growth-at-all-costs mentality, which inevitably led to bloated 
cost structures.
● Starting in 2020, growth stalled amid economic uncertainty and recession 
fears, while high acquisition costs persisted. Rising interest rates began to 
compress valuation multiples from as much as 40x down to 8x.
● In the summer of 2022, there was a signiﬁcant shift towards cost control. 
Then, in early 2023, the collapse of SVB marked a turning point away from 
the growth-at-all-costs trend. However, even as companies started 
reducing growth guidance, expense cuts remained relatively shallow.
● In 2024, the era of sustainable growth begins. Companies are starting 
to manage the costs of growth and aim for a long-term target of 30% 
operating margins. Highly proﬁtable, high-growth companies are 
emerging.
This trajectory shows a clear path toward a more proﬁtable and sustainable 
future.
In summary: During the Golden Era, SaaS companies aimed for high valuations, 
often relying on a single metric—the growth rate. With ready access to low-cost 
capital, they received virtually unlimited funding, driving growth with minimal 
oversight, resulting in a pervasive growth-at-all-costs mentality. This relentless 
pursuit of growth led to an increased demand for unskilled and 
technology–assisted labor, prioritizing quantity over quality in serving 
customers. The time has come to transition to a new, more sustainable 
framework. It promises an era of sustainable growth and the rise of high-quality, 
billion-dollar B2B software companies. As we look toward a future deﬁned by 
growth, we turn our attention to an unconventional yet promising domain—the 
factory model.

THE RECURRING REVENUE FACTORY
When one thinks of a factory, images of stark, grueling environments with 
monotonous production lines may come to mind—hardly the ideal of a dynamic 
modern workplace. Of course, this isn't the vision we aim for with the recurring 
revenue factory. Consider this: throughout history, factories have spearheaded 
technological advances to the extent that today, we give a number to the 
industrial revolutions they have caused. Each has brought a monumental shift 
made possible by new foundational principles upon which the next generation  
of factories could be built. We envision the revenue factory as an example of a 
fourth-generation factory designed to drive eﬃcient, high-quality growth.
The Goal of a Factory: Cost Eﬃcient Production of Quality Products
Factories have always served as symbols of the implementation of organized, 
systematic methodologies. At its core, a factory aims to enhance production and 
achieve economies of scale, leading to reduced unit costs as production 
numbers increase. However, the pursuit of increased volume and cost reduction 
historically has resulted in quality issues. This brings us to a third crucial goal of 
a factory, as emphasized by the renowned W. Edwards Deming: Quality. His 
approach to quality is deeply rooted in processes that prioritize the customer, 
rely on data-driven decision-making, and embrace a culture of continuous 
improvement. Deming's teachings on quality management have left an indelible 
mark on the manufacturing industry and played a pivotal role in shaping the 
global quality management movement.
The Impact of the Industrial Revolution 
The Industrial Revolution transformed small, decentralized, and often craft- 
based workshops into large-scale, centralized, and mechanized industrial 
facilities. These advances span multiple generations. Known as "industrial 
revolutions," each marks a major shift in industrial and technological capabilities. 
These revolutions have reshaped our world, resulting in profound changes 
across social, economic, and technological dimensions.

The Golden Era Thrived on Automation, Part of the Third Industrial Revolution
For example, during the Golden Era, many developments were the result of the 
Third Industrial Revolution (3IR). With the transition to a subscription-based 
revenue model, the revenue per customer declined, necessitating a signiﬁcant 
increase in customer acquisition to meet growth objectives. This led to a 
demand for more customers and leads well before achieving operational 
maturity to handle such growth. The SaaS industry turned to a product of the 
Third Industrial Revolution: Automation. Email automation, in particular, played  
a pivotal role in increasing production of emails, enhancing production 
consistency through email sequencing, and improving quality using templated 
emails. This approach, by its very nature, led to cost reduction, as a single 
prospector with automation tools could achieve the work of many

Mapping a Factory Approach to Producing Recurring Revenue
The analogy of a subscription business with a factory extends beyond mere 
automation. Just like a factory that produces revenue growth, a subscription 
business operates with similar objectives. In fact, the goals of a factory align to 
those of a recurring revenue business perfectly:
Factory Goals       Goals of a Recurring Revenue Factory 
● Increase Production⇒ Achieve Growth  
● Improve Eﬃciency ⇒ Lower Costs 
● Enhance Quality       ⇒ Deliver the Promised Impact
The ﬁrst goal in both factories and subscription businesses is clear: increase 
output. In factories, this means more production, akin to achieving growth in 
subscription businesses. Historically this was driven by a growth-at-all-costs 
approach. Today's emphasis on sustainable growth in subscriptions mirrors the 
factory's aim for eﬃciency. The analogy further extends to the methods of 
increasing output: just as factories use different production lines to create a 
variety of products from the same materials, subscription businesses deploy 
various GTM motions to diversify their revenue streams

in a cost-eﬃcient way
A subscription business operates like a revenue factory with a number of production 
lines (GTM motions). Each production line signiﬁes a different revenue stream, 
characterized by speciﬁc growth metrics and cost structures.

Sustainable and capital-eﬃcient growth are similar but not the same: 
Sustainable growth involves maintaining a consistent long-term growth 
rate without encountering operational or ﬁnancial hurdles. Companies 
achieving this show strong revenue retention metrics like GRR and NRR, 
balancing resource allocation. On the other hand, capital-eﬃcient growth 
focuses on how well a company uses its capital for expansion, typically 
measured by revenue or proﬁt per investment unit, with Free Cash Flow 
(FCF) as a key metric. While sustainable growth is about long term 
viability, capital-eﬃcient growth aims for cost-effective expansion. Both 
are crucial for the success of a recurring revenue business.
SUSTAINABLE VS. CAPITAL-EFFICIENT GROWTH
23
Similarly, we can identify the shift toward cost-conscious growth, which today 
is referred to as “sustainable growth,” prioritizing cost reduction, or what VCs 
have termed “capital-eﬃcient growth,” aimed at increasing Free Cash Flow. 
These objectives are inward-focused and do not directly beneﬁt the customer.
This is where the importance of the third goal, Quality, becomes evident. In a 
factory context, “Quality” signiﬁes a product's consistent ability to perform its 
intended function. When applied to SaaS products, this concept translates to 
its ability to reliably deliver the promised results, again and again, commonly 
referred to as “delivering recurring impact.” To implement the Recurring 
Revenue Factory, we can identify the essential tasks:
● Achieve Growth⇒ Implement eﬃcient processes for scalability.
● Lower Costs ⇒ Apply unit economics to ensure sustainability.
● Recurring Impact⇒ Instill quality management for long-term durability.
Historically, operationalization followed a departmental approach, where each 
department aimed to achieve speciﬁc targets. However, achieving results in a 
Recurring Revenue Factory requires a more integrated approach, which we will 
refer to as the GTM approach. This approach emphasizes cross-functional 
collaboration and alignment across departments to drive recurring impact.

The Increase in Volume and Velocity 
In 2010, closing a perpetual software deal in the enterprise sector could generate 
revenue ranging from $500,000 to $10,000,000 up front. These numbers typically 
did not account for an additional 18% to 22% per year allocated for annual 
upgrade and support contracts, which were commonly established for at least 
another 3 years. Enterprise sellers would concentrate on a restricted number of 
qualiﬁed opportunities annually, typically achieving a 30% win rate. Sales cycles in 
this context often extended for an average of 18 months, and in some instances, 
as long as 3 years. This level of effort would typically generate annual revenue of 
around $2,000,000 for a junior rep and well above $4,000,000 for a senior rep. 
We can compare that to the subscription-based services market in which a 
solution similar in scope brings in $100,000 in annual contract value (ACV) with a 
sales cycle ranging from 6 to 9 months. In this scenario, the same experienced 
rep would carry a lower target around $1,200,000. This would require the rep to 
secure 12 commitments per year. Based on today's win rate of 20%, the seller 
would, therefore, need to work on 60 qualiﬁed opportunities per year. This would 
be a challenge for most of today’s enterprise reps. When we contrast this with an 
SMB sale, these numbers escalate even further. For example, a deal with an ACV 
of $10,000 against a quota of $500,000 requires a total of 50 wins per year and 
require as many as 50 qualiﬁed opportunities per month. Win rates and sales 
cycles will vary depending on factors such as industry, product, market 
conditions, and company strategies. However, the overall outcome remains the 
same: a much higher velocity and an order of magnitude increase in deal volume 
compared to a perpetual business.
In summary: The goal of a recurring revenue business is to achieve the highest 
growth rate in the most cost-eﬃcient manner. The Revenue Factory tackles this 
challenge by streamlining processes and enhancing eﬃciency through iterative 
improvements, thereby ensuring consistent delivery of recurring impact. To 
achieve this, companies must shift from a traditional departmental approach to a 
more collaborative, cross-departmental approach known as a GTM approach.

THE GO-TO-MARKET APPROACH
The integration of various functions in marketing, sales, and customer success 
forms what is referred to as the Go-To-Market (GTM) approach. This approach 
aligns the product with market needs and business goals. It aims to build 
awareness among prospective customers, educate them on the product's 
merits, help sell it effectively and eﬃciently, and importantly, ensure consistent 
delivery on what was promised. The GTM approach serves as the driving force 
behind growth, and its signiﬁcance cannot be overstated.
Today's Departmental Approach 
Traditionally, each department functioned autonomously, employing distinct 
means and methods to achieve its objectives. For example, the marketing 
department, led by the CMO, focused on generating awareness and providing 
qualiﬁed leads to support the sales team. Similarly, the sales and customer 
success departments operated independently, each with its own set of metrics 
and tools speciﬁc to their functions. However, it doesn't stop there. Companies 
structure and organize their resources differently within each department. 
Marketing departments are divided into distinct functions that operate in parallel, 
such as Content Marketing, Email Marketing, and Demand Generation, with each 
responsible for speciﬁc programs or campaigns. 
1.3
25
Today, recurring revenue businesses operate in silos, in which each department focuses 
on its own objectives. A GTM approach breaks down these silos and emphasizes 
cross-functional collaboration and alignment across departments.

Sales teams are segmented based on regions, vertical markets, or company 
size. Customer success is typically organized with functions operating 
sequentially, such as onboarding, renewals, and expansion.
The Impact of Silos
With the departmental approach, each department has its unique structure built 
around speciﬁc deliverables. The consequence of such an approach is that it 
creates silos within the organization. These silos in turn create ineﬃciencies, 
including duplicated efforts and a lack of alignment towards broader company 
objectives. For instance, the marketing team might focus on generating leads 
that the sales team is unaware of, or the customer success team might miss 
opportunities for upselling or cross-selling due to a lack of alignment with the 
sales department. Team members working from different locations (remote) 
further complicates cross-department/cross- functional coordination. Such a 
lack of coordination has hindered overall company performance and growth. 
This heightened level of complexity necessitates organized restructuring, 
leading us to a cross-functional GTM approach where departments work 
collaboratively and share information to achieve the common objective: deliver 
Recurring Impact to attain Recurring Revenue. This shift aims to break down the 
silos, leading to greater organizational eﬃciency and effectiveness.

Introducing the GTM Motion
Where a factory has product lines, a revenue factory has GTM motions. A GTM 
motion refers to a company's structured set of activities, tactics, and processes 
that span across the entire customer journey. It starts with ﬁnding prospects, 
qualiﬁes them, and ultimately turns them into satisﬁed customers. This approach 
involves collaboration across functions from the marketing, sales, and customer 
success departments. The aim of a GTM motion is to enhance organizational 
eﬃciency by reducing costs and boosting effectiveness through increased 
production or growth, alongside improving customer experience.
Go Fast and Go Long
Different types of GTM motions are suited to different business models, products, 
and customer bases. They are essential for scaling business operations and 
achieving a sustainable, proﬁtable growth rate. For example, an "inbound GTM 
motion" might involve generating leads through content marketing, qualifying 
them via technology or human interactions, and then handing them off to a sales 
team to gain a commitment. In that scenario, they will trigger dozens of 
micro-actions, pass through at least 3 different departments, and do so all within 
mere minutes.

On the other hand, an "Enterprise motion" might involve targeted outreach to 
large companies, using a dedicated sales force backed by high-level marketing 
and account management efforts. This may take a consistent approach for a 
long period of time. The goal of a GTM motion is to ensure that, amid all this 
activity, the customer has the best possible experience. It aims to create 
coherence across all these actions and make the interactions appear smooth. 
For this we are going to use the concept of GTM motions. 
Different GTM Motions
Thinking about GTM motions leads us to a deeper understanding of revenue 
growth and its associated costs, both of which are essential components of 
achieving a proﬁtable business model. In this book we will explore the following 
5 GTM motions:
● No Touch: Customers are marketing, selling, and servicing the products.
● Low Touch: Marketing, sales, and support relies on technology, like chatbots, 
with personal engagement reserved for more complex situations.
● Medium Touch: Involves specialized roles like a Sales Development Rep 
(SDR) or Customer Success Manager (CSM) qualifying a customer's needs 
before involving a Sales Manager or product expert.
● High Touch: A Sales Manager or Customer Success Manager, often 
ﬁeld-based, oversees a small portfolio of accounts. For advanced 
solutions, this likely involves support from a Solutions Architect.
● Dedicated Touch: A dedicated team solely focused on serving one 
large Fortune 500 account, often led by an executive who reports 
directly to the CEO, ensuring a comprehensive approach to both   sales 
and service needs.
Each of these GTM motions operates on a different cost structure. For example, 
it would make no sense to ﬂy cross country to close a $10/month deal. This 
means that to be sustainable requires that we map the right GTM motion to the 
revenue generated by the customer over time.

C H A P T E R   0 1   |   I N T R O D U C T I O N
Matching Products with GTM Motions
Just as a company can have multiple products each generating its own 
revenue stream, a single product can have multiple GTM motions, also with 
their own revenue stream (see Figure 1.9). For example:
● Scenario 1: A product-led growth (PLG) product employs an inbound 
motion to attract pro-users, generating leads through content marketing.
● Scenario 2: A single product utilizes 3 separate GTM motions. For 
example, an inbound motion is in place for targeting SMB accounts, a 
ﬁeld sales team focuses on Enterprise accounts, and a dedicated team 
caters to a select few strategic accounts.
● Scenario 3: Three distinct products are each aligned with their own 
GTM motion. For instance, Product A targets pro-users through an 
inbound motion. Product B aims at the SMB market using an outbound 
motion. Finally, Product C focuses on the Enterprise sector, employing a 
ﬁeld sales motion.
By understanding different GTM motions and scenarios, businesses can 
strategize on varied paths to growth. Some GTM motions might be slower 
but generate substantial recurring revenue, like the Enterprise GTM motion. 
Others might offer a much higher deal volume but come at a lower ACV.

Cost of a GTM Motion
A crucial aspect of different GTM motions is aligning the cost with the revenue 
it generates. For instance, if you sell a multimillion-dollar solution, you can't 
expect customers to purchase it by watching a demo video and presenting 
their credit card information; they will want to engage with multiple specialists 
and stakeholders. 
Conversely, if you sell a $5/month subscription, customers don't expect an 
on-site visit. Actually, they will probably prefer to watch a video and enter their 
credit card information in a self-serve portal. In essence, the cost of the GTM 
motion must be aligned with the recurring revenue it produces.
From 2018 to 2021, we witnessed a signiﬁcant increase in the cost of GTM 
motions (see Figure 1.10). The 2022 SaaS market crash was caused by 
companies paying twice as much for GTM motions.

became more costly than a high-touch approach relying on a single seller (Sr. AE).

The Need for Sustainable GTM Motions
Creating a sustainable business relies on implementing cost-effective GTM 
motion anchored in proven, repeatable processes. This requires utilizing 
technology for more affordable task execution or hiring individuals at standard 
wages for routine tasks, instead of depending on scarce, exceptionally skilled, 
and highly paid talent.
The surge in demand for subscription-based services has fueled the rapid 
expansion of SaaS companies, skyrocketing from approximately 1,000 in 
2011 to a staggering 35,000 by 2023. These companies have adopted 
similar GTM motions, often with the assistance of popular technology.
For example, between 2015 and 2020, the outbound GTM motion 
featuring an inside sales team emerged as the preferred approach. This 
strategy leveraged cutting-edge email hyper-personalization and 
sequencing technologies. However, as automation increased 
production, the success rate of outbound emails declined.
In 2015, it took over 100 cold outbound emails to generate a single 
opportunity. By 2018, this number had risen to 200 cold outbound 
attempts, including emails, calls, and social interactions. In 2023, it 
had surged over 1,000 cold outbound attempts to generate one 
opportunity.
This created an insatiable thirst for leads to call on, resulting in soaring 
lead acquisition costs. But it didn't stop there. It generated a demand for 
more salespeople to send out more emails, which drove up salaries. For 
instance, entry-level Sales Development Representative (SDR) positions, 
which had a starting annual salary of around $35,000 in 2015, had 
climbed to $55,000 by 2018. By 2023, the target earnings for a US-based 
SDR reached $80,586, according to ZipRecruiter reports.
This led to the cost of outbound doubling from 2018 to 2023.

1.3.5 The Problem Only Got Worse
Several years after the crash, the SaaS industry is still struggling to ﬁnd scalable 
and sustainable GTM motions. This challenge is evident in the trend of 
marketing and sales costs as a percentage of newly acquired revenue, depicted 
in Figure 1.11. Despite initial cost reductions due to workforce downsizing, the 
expenses subsequently increased. By the end of 2023, the cost of acquisition 
had worsened to 1.5 times the severity observed at the outset of the crash. The 
issue stems from the industry's failure to adapt their GTM motions in the years 
that followed the crash.
The trend toward cost reduction and Free Cash Flow (FCF) generation, especially 
among venture-backed companies, led to the continuation of ineﬃcient practices. 
The widespread availability of AI tools exacerbated the problem by enabling 
startups to continue their aggressive "Grow at all costs" strategies at a lower cost. 
While a healthy focus on FCF is generally prudent, a lack of operational capability 
to apply this to GTM motions led to a decline in growth. This phenomenon was 
reported by David Spitz from Benchsights who looked at the data from publicly 
listed SaaS companies. It revealed a decline in average growth rate from 36% to 
18%, effectively halving it (see Figure 1.12).
Cost of Acquisition and Expansion depicts that the GTM problem is not solved.FIGURE 1.11

 33
The combination of the decline in growth rate, and the increase in cost of 
acquisition tell us that the GTM challenges faced by late-stage startups and 
scaleups are worsening. These challenges can often be traced back to lack of 
knowledge and expertise in revenue architecture. The teams that operate the 
recurring revenue machine, commonly do not understand how it works. Thus, 
it's reasonable to predict that a sustainable GTM strategy will become a key 
success differentiator for venture-backed companies in the coming years, and 
that Revenue Architecture will play an important role.
Navigating Growth Stages 
A high-velocity organization undergoes various stages of growth in a relatively 
short time frame. What an average company accomplishes in 40 years, a 
hypergrowth subscription-based company achieves in about 10 years—4 times 
faster—by progressing through a series of growth stages and critical milestones. 
Growth stages 
Growth stages in SaaS mark a ﬁrm's maturation and business evolution. Each 
stage comes with unique challenges, objectives, and key performance indicators.

For simplicity, we will keep it to 3 growth stages here: 
● Startup Stage: In this initial phase, SaaS startups aim to validate their 
product–market ﬁt by acquiring the ﬁrst set of customers willing to pay 
for the product. That makes the product the star of the show, and rightly 
so. However, once they have validated the product and gained traction, 
the focus shifts from having a great product to selling it at scale.
● Scaleup Stage: SaaS companies in the Scaleup stage focus on rapid 
growth, expanding revenue from $10 million to $500 million, by launching 
multiple GTM motions and optimizing each GTM motion for proﬁtability.
● Grownup Stage: Representing maturity, SaaS companies shift their focus 
entirely to proﬁtability, operational eﬃciency, adhering to metrics related to 
publicly traded companies.
From initial ideation and securing ﬁrst customers to scaling operations and 
optimizing for proﬁtability across GTM motions, understanding these stages 
helps SaaS businesses allocate resources effectively, target the right customer 
segments, and implement growth strategies tailored to their current phase. 
Critical Milestones
In the SaaS industry, success hinges on a few critical milestones:
● Product-Market Fit (PMF) ensures that the software isn't just another 
product; it means it addresses a genuine market need, and different 
customers are willing to pay for it, often indicated by reaching $1M in ARR.
● Go-To-Market Fit (GTMF) focuses on how you effectively bring your 
product to the masses. It's not only about the value your software offers 
but also how you present, and deliver that value.
Achieving PMF means you have created a product that customers ﬁnd 
valuable enough to pay for. GTMF, on the other hand, ensures this product is 
presented to, and reaches the right audience, eﬃciently. True GTMF goes 
beyond consistently hitting growth targets by acquiring new customers; it 
involves reliably delivering value to customers, thus fostering retention and 
enhancing lifetime value for both the seller and the buyer. Typically, reaching 
true GTMF is a process that spans years – and for good reason.

The importance of GTM grows signiﬁcantly as a company evolves from a Startup into a 
Scaleup. This transformation requires a company to make drastic changes.

● Going IPO by offering shares to the general public allows a company to raise 
substantial capital from external investors, enabling further expansion and 
growth. Going public also brings increased scrutiny, regulatory compliance, 
and transparency requirements. It's worth noting that not all successful SaaS 
companies go public; some opt for acquisitions or other forms of exit. 
● Fortune 2000 reﬂects a company has achieved over $5B in revenue, and is 
seen as a major accomplishment in the business world.
This requires a signiﬁcant shift in focus as the company matures, moving from a 
product-centric approach to emphasizing GTM-centric approach. This shift is 
referred to as a Phase Shift, a topic we will delve into next.
35
In summary: A successful recurring revenue factory depends on multiple scalable 
and sustainable GTM motions, which cover all customer-facing roles. The GTM 
motions are tailored to align with buyers' purchasing preferences, ranging from 
the Low Touch motion used for inbound businesses to the High Touch motion 
used for enterprise sales. Ideally, each GTM motion should achieve sustainability 
before hitting $10M in ARR.

PHASE SHIFTING
Think of the 3 growth stages mentioned earlier (see Figure 1.13) as akin to the 
educational system, where you ﬁrst attend elementary school, then move on to 
high school, followed by college. The progression through growth stages is 
similar to progressing through school, where each school prepares you for the 
next one. Each school is different, very different; consider the difference 
between college and high school for example. This reﬂects how different each 
growth stage is. And each school has a clear end to it—a graduation.
Schooling vs. Scaling
Unlike the educational system, where you know when you graduate, the 
transitions between growth stages are less deﬁned. In many cases, one 
growth stage ﬂows seamlessly into another; this is referred to as a phase 
shift. For example, the transition from Startup to Scaleup represents a phase 
shift, but there are many others:
● From founder-led to sales-led growth.
● From grow at all costs to sustainable growth.
● From a people-centric to a process-centric culture.
● From a SMB to an Enterprise GTM motion.
● From domestic to international growth.
● From a single product to a product portfolio.
● From non-GAAP to GAAP compliance.
● From a private to a public company (IPO)
These are just a few examples of phase shifts a company experiences. While in 
the educational system, people "phase shift" from one school to the next every 4 
to 6 years, hypergrowth companies experience multiple phase shifts, often 2 to 
3 simultaneously, over the span of a few years. Each growth stage requires a 
different set of strategies, a new set of metrics, involves new

leadership, different systems, demands more advanced processes, and so on. 
This explains why phase shifts can take time, on average, around 18 months, 
making them a signiﬁcant undertaking that demands the full attention of the 
CEO and careful planning by those involved on the executive team.
37
Executives are aware of most of these phase shifts, but they are unaware of the 
process of a phase shift, so they spend most of their time reacting to the effects 
of past phase shifts rather than preparing for the next one. The presence of 
departmental silos and the constant turnover of staff only make this more 
daunting. Perhaps this helps explain why the grow-at-all-costs mindset has 
endured for such an extended period, while we all knew it no longer worked. It’s 
just so much more convenient to continue with the status quo.
In summary: Revenue Architecture, as a discipline, establishes the scientiﬁc 
foundation for Recurring Revenue growth and serves as a linchpin in driving 
these transformative phase shifts, in particular those involving GTM motions. 
Through a series of models, it not only educates but also guide companies on 
their growth journey, It helps them to proactively prepare for phase shifts, rather 
than merely reacting to them.

RECAP
The Golden Era of SaaS, which spanned from 2011 to late 2021, was marked by 
remarkable growth and innovation. However, its abrupt end in early 2022 can be 
attributed to the unsustainable grow-at-all-costs approach that had become the 
norm. This resulted in companies going public prematurely, often with 
insuﬃcient revenue, while relying on immature marketing and sales strategies.
Although a shift to a sustainable approach is essential, it alone will not address 
the operational growth challenges, and when applied incorrectly it is likely to 
have adverse effects that focusing on cost reduction often leads to a decline in 
product quality. The product quality in a recurring revenue business is what 
leads to renewals.
To tackle these challenges, we are introducing a simple concept: To operate a 
recurring revenue business as if it were a factory, a Recurring Revenue Factory, 
and see each GTM motion as a production line. This approach draws inspiration 
from the best practices from the industrial revolution, and it customizes them to 
suit to the distinctive needs of recurring revenue businesses.

In summary: The Revenue Factory emerges in response to the 2022 market 
crash, aiming to establish recurring revenue through recurring impact. This 
objective hinges on cross-functional collaboration, the adoption of a GTM 
approach, and the strategic use of GTM motions. Revenue Architecture 
provides a guiding framework to design, build, and operate a successful 
recurring revenue factory based on GTM motions.

The shift in perspective requires that organizations break away from their 
traditional departmental approach, silos, and instead develop cross-functional 
collaboration.
Central to this transformation is the GTM approach that brings together all 
functions that call on a customer under a GTM motion. We identiﬁed 5 speciﬁc 
GTM motions: No Touch, Low Touch, Medium Touch, High Touch, and Dedicated 
Touch. These motions offer ﬂexibility to tailor to different business models and 
customer needs. Implementing such a transformative change is not without 
challenges and takes time, typically requiring an 18-month phase shift.

WHAT IS NEXT?
Just as an architect meticulously designs a bridge to ensure its longevity, stability, 
and eﬃciency through the use of proven frameworks, Revenue Architecture uses a 
series of established frameworks. This is vital to achieve the same level of rigor in 
designing, building, and deploying a revenue factory. 
● Part I. Fundamentals: This section covers the scientiﬁc frameworks upon 
which a recurring revenue factory is based, including First Principles, Models 
& Data, and Systems & Processes.
● Part II. Design: Here, we explore the design of a recurring revenue factory, 
which is based on a series of frameworks that form a foundation. This 
includes The Revenue Model, The Data Model, and The Mathematical Model. 
● Part III. Build: To build the factory, more frameworks are utilized, designed to 
enable a business to adapt to frequent market changes. These are The 
Operating Model, The Growth Model, and The Go-to-Market Model.
● Part IV. Deploy: For most organizations, adopting a scientiﬁc approach does 
not come naturally. It requires guidance on operating it with an emphasis on 
continuous and iterative improvement.
Let's begin by exploring the fundamentals upon which a recurring revenue 
factory is based, as this understanding is crucial for the successful operation 
of a recurring revenue business.

Revenue Architecture uses scientiﬁc principles to optimize for growth, and 
is not the ﬁrst discipline to do so. Many other industries have already done 
this: manufacturing, sports, medicine, healthcare, economics, agriculture, 
transportation, design, and architecture, to name a few. These industries 
have all embraced a scientiﬁc foundation to drive growth.
The Core Scientiﬁc Principles of Revenue Architecture
We start by looking at 3 interconnected scientiﬁc principles: 
● First Principles (Chapter 2)
● Models and Data (Chapter 3)
● Systems and Processes (Chapter 4)
Three scientiﬁc principles form the foundation for building a recurring revenue factory.FIGURE I1

First, the Shift Towards Customer-Centric Growth
Recurring business thrives on customer-centricity, emphasizing impactful 
solution delivery. As a result, revenue growth becomes an organic outcome 
rather than the ultimate objective. Previously, we might have prioritized growth 
for its own sake, aiming for achievements like unicorn status or an IPO. By 
reorienting our approach to emphasize customer-centricity, we unveil the true 
potential of recurring revenue, fostering sustainable and lasting growth.
Next, Harnessing Models and Data for Growth
With a solid grasp of the ﬁrst principles we utilize models to design and 
test our growth engine. These models serve as blueprints and establish a 
structured framework that simulates revenue dynamics. They empower us 
to make informed decisions as we scale our recurring revenue operation from 
$10 million in ARR to $1 billion. During this process, data is used to validate 
and ﬁne-tune the models, ensuring their accuracy and relevance to the 
current reality.
Lastly, Transitioning From Theory to Practice Through Systems & Processes
Modeling allows us to make well-informed decisions and optimize our growth 
approach. As we advance, we reﬁne and enhance the Growth Model. We then 
transition from theory to reality through implementation. This involves setting 
up systems and processes that turn the insights, strategies, and analyses 
derived from the ﬁrst principles, models, and data into an operational model 
that can be implemented in real-life scenarios.
An Example of Applying Scientiﬁc Principles in Building Construction
The application of scientiﬁc principles can be found all around us. Today, 
architects utilize First Principles, Models & Data, and Systems & Processes 
to enhance structural integrity, design performance, and construction eﬃciency. 
This approach allows for the construction of modern architect-designed 
buildings in large quantities, while maintaining high quality and relatively low 
costs.

In this chapter, we will delve into the source code of a potent growth engine  
capable of signiﬁcantly enhancing a company's revenue. We'll shed light on the 
core differences between growth strategies anchored in perpetual monetization 
with an upfront-payment model and those rooted in subscription monetization 
that relies on a recurring revenue model.
Harnessing First Principles for Recurring Revenue Growth
The recurring revenue engine, primarily utilized by subscription services, hasn't 
reached its full potential. The primary hindrance is a lack of understanding of 
where growth comes from, and the unfamiliarity by the operators of the 
capabilities of the extremely powerful growth engine under the hood. In many 
ways it is akin to using a Ferrari as a lawnmower. To truly harness the power of 
the recurring revenue engine, it's vital to comprehend the mechanics of the 
growth engine that it thrives on. This is about dissecting growth into essential 
components, challenging conventional beliefs, and gleaning insights from 
unshakeable truths.
Unraveling the Recurring Revenue Mystery
By invoking ﬁrst principles thinking, we can decipher the fundamental 
components of growth. With this knowledge, crafting a clear, actionable, and 
phased growth strategy becomes straightforward, paving the way for its 
seamless implementation. Such an approach will amplify recurring revenue 
beneﬁts and foster sustained business growth.

2.1 FIRST PRINCIPLES THINKING EXPLAINED
In the movie Moneyball, a vivid demonstration of ﬁrst principles thinking unfolds. 
The ﬁlm follows Billy Beane (portrayed by Brad Pitt), the general manager of the 
Oakland A's baseball team. Instead of relying on traditional scouting methods, 
Beane turns to statistical analysis and advanced metrics (Sabermetrics). 
This allows him to spot undervalued players who possess the exact skills that 
lead to game victories. By deconstructing baseball to its core components and 
zeroing in on the elements crucial to success, Beane manages to build a 
formidable team despite ﬁnancial constraints. His pioneering approach not only 
challenges but also upends the age-old reliance on gut feelings and outdated 
metrics, setting a new standard for player assessment in baseball.
Reasoning by Analogy 
In the Moneyball story, the act of relying on past strategies and assuming that 
what previously worked will continue to succeed is referred to as "reasoning 
by analogy." It's a natural human inclination, predicated on the belief that the 
familiar and the known provide a predictable path. However, as we'll understand, 
this is often not the case, especially when the business landscape experiences 
signiﬁcant shifts. Today, many companies adhere to outdated methods in their 
quests for growth. Speciﬁcally, they employ marketing and sales strategies 
initially designed for on-prem hardware and perpetual software. This mindset is 
a manifestation of reasoning by analogy. While reasoning by analogy has merits, 
it falters during signiﬁcant change, frequently failing to adapt promptly to the 
latest trends and innovations.
Currently, marketing and sales teams are entrenched in reasoning by analogy, 
persisting in retroﬁtting their programs to market and sell using a perpetual 
software GTM approach where sellers receive payment up front. They then 
attempt to adapt it to a subscription-based business model, which relies on 
recurring revenue—a fundamentally different monetization strategy.

A Practical Illustration
A tangible instance of reasoning by analogy is evident in the role of sales 
development reps (SDRs). Circa 2015, SDRs predominantly focused on emailing 
many prospects to secure discovery calls. This strategy stemmed from the 
belief that if you knock on more doors, you'll create more opportunities to sell. 
This belief catalyzed a surge in tools designed to automate this approach, 
making dispatching hundreds of tailored emails as simple as sending just one. 
The prevalent thought was "the more effort, the higher the return." Initially, it was 
effective. However, as this methodology became mainstream, potential buyers 
became inundated with personalized emails.
Is More Always Better?
What if the "more is always better" axiom is misguided? What if the act of 
sending countless emails not only fails to deliver the desired outcome but also 
jeopardizes successful engagement with the ideal clientele? While reasoning 
by analogy might suggest "craft better emails" or "send messages to their 
LinkedIn inbox," it may overlook the possibility that the volume of messages 
isn't the root issue. And to make matters worse, these strategies failed to 
deliver and consume precious resources, dramatically inﬂating acquisition
and retention costs.
Embracing the First Principles Approach
The idea behind ﬁrst principles thinking is to break out of this cycle and avoid 
being limited by preconceived notions or assumptions. It cautions against 
repeatedly deploying ineffective strategies in the faint hope they might someday 
prove fruitful again. Instead, ﬁrst principles thinking offers a methodology to 
tackle challenges with a renewed outlook.

FUNDAMENTALS OF GROWTH
To combat reasoning by analogy and establish accurate ﬁrst principles, we must 
analyze the origins of growth, challenge assumptions, and seek empirical 
evidence to better understand the origins of growth.
Unveiling the Origins of Recurring Revenue Growth
One of the wonders of the subscription model is that revenue doesn't reset to 
zero each year. If all your ﬁrst-year customers renew in the second year, and you 
gain an equal number of new customers, your revenue doubles. Add expansion 
from existing customers to the mix, and the growth compounds.
But there's more to the story of recurring revenue growth. To gain a deeper 
understanding, let's delve into the recurring revenue stream of BestCo—a 
real-world SaaS company operating on a subscription model.

By breaking down the ARR into 3 components—retention, expansion, and 
acquisition—we see that a business undergoes 3 distinct steps to achieve rapid 
growth:
Step 1: Growth through acquisition.
Step 2: Growth through retention.
Step 3: Growth through expansion.
Graphing the data helps us understand what is happening (see Figure 2.1) 
ARR [mUSD]
Breaking down the ARR into 3 components, and determining a trendline for each.FIGURE 2.1
The graph displays total revenue (ARR) broken down into its 3 components, each 
represented by a different column. Trendlines for each component are also 
shown. This visual representation enables us to make crucial observations:
● Observation 1: The ARR line exhibits exponential growth, following a 
polynomial curve, which we are accustomed to seeing in a healthy 
recurring revenue business.

## Page 52

C H A P T E R   0 2   |   F I R S T   P R I N C I P L E S
● Observation 2: The growth rate from retention follows an exponential 
curve, while the growth rate from acquisition is ﬂattening.
● Observation 3: When we isolate the revenue numbers from expansion, 
as seen in Figure 2.2, it becomes evident that expansion also exhibits 
an exponential growth pattern.
And most importantly,
● Observation 4: The trendline for retention closely mirrors that of the 
ARR line.
These observations convey that we're experiencing hypergrowth primarily due to 
the substantial revenue generated from retention. However, let's not jump to 
conclusions just yet. It's important to remember that you can't retain revenue 
that you haven't acquired in the ﬁrst place. Nonetheless, this underscores the 
increasing signiﬁcance of revenue retention in a subscription business.

The First Step: Growth Through Acquisition
Let’s take a closer look: In 2013, BestCo started with $900,000 from acquisitions, 
with no revenue from retention or expansion. In the following years, revenue 
from acquisitions grew to $1.87 million and then to $5.79 million. This marked 
the moment when the revenue engine kick started.
The $5.79 million from acquisitions in 2015 contributed to a total ARR of $8.69 
million for that year. Much of the revenue acquired up to 2015 was retained in 
2016. Additionally, the acquisition team maintained its momentum, causing the 
ARR for 2016 to nearly double from $8.69 million to $15.46 million, even though 
the growth rate didn't experience a signiﬁcant jump.
Kickstarting Growth: The Role of the Founder
The recurring revenue engine needs an early kickstart, often initiated by the 
founder taking on the role of the seller. In the context of PLG, instead of direct 
selling, the founder can focus on tasks such as addressing feature requests 
through social media or ﬁxing bugs, similar to Eric Yuan's actions for Zoom 
during the pandemic. Following this initial phase, it's crucial for a professional 
team to take over. In PLG, this transition occurs when the ﬁrst cohorts of 
customers start generating buzz and bringing in new users. In the case of 
BestCo, this pivotal step occurred in 2014/2015 when they hired a sales team, 
leading to revenue growth from $1.87 million to $5.79 million.
The Big Step: Transitioning From Acquisition to Retention
In the initial years of a recurring revenue business, growth heavily depends on 
acquisition. Nevertheless, there comes a point when growth should shift its 
focus towards retention and expansion. In the case of BestCo, we can observe 
that from 2013 to 2016, the company primarily experienced growth through 
acquisition. However, starting in 2016, revenue from retention began to exceed 
the revenue acquired from acquisition and by 2019, revenue from retention was 
more than twice that of the revenue from acquisition.

C H A P T E R   0 2   |   F I R S T   P R I N C I P L E S
While it may seem that growth from retention and expansion occurs by itself in 
the early years, many companies encounter challenges that lead to a slowdown 
in growth. Many factors contribute to this, and we'll highlight 3 that are familiar to 
those who have worked in hypergrowth companies:
● Cause 1. The Revolving Door of Revenue Leadership 
In the case of BestCo, the growth rate from acquisition ﬂattened 
towards the end of 2016, leading to the replacement of the VP of Sales 
due to missing growth targets—the very same VP who hired the ﬁrst 
sales team and built the acquisition growth engine. The newly hired CRO 
came in and immediately implemented a more rigorous sales process 
and brought in a few high-performing individuals. These efforts resulted 
in continued growth from acquisition in 2017 and 2018. However, in 
2019, growth from acquisition again began leveling off, causing BestCo 
to fear that its growth engine had stalled once more, prompting the CEO 
to begin searching for a new sales leader.
● Cause 2. Investing in Acquisition at the Onset of Growth Slowdown
A slowdown in growth often prompts management to invest more in 
acquisition, typically by hiring more salespeople. But is this the right 
approach? Let's not forget that hiring salespeople is expensive, causing 
the cost of acquisition to rise just when the growth rate starts to 
decrease. 
All of this is a result of a fundamental misunderstanding of how to 
operate a recurring revenue factory. It's akin to using a high- 
performance sports car as a lawnmower, with the recurring revenue 
engine being the sports car primarily used for acquisition-driven growth. 
This analogy underscores the need for a shift in strategy to maximize 
the potential of recurring revenue through retention and expansion, 
rather than overinvesting in acquisition when growth slows down.

## Page 55

C H A P T E R   0 2   |   F I R S T   P R I N C I P L E S 55
● Cause 3: They Wait Too Long
In most SaaS companies, a common issue is that they remain overly 
focused on acquisition without a timely shift toward retention. This 
transition encompasses various aspects, including engineering, product 
development, and more, and it isn't solely dependent on hiring customer 
success managers (CSMs). Typically, it takes about 2 years to make the 
phase shift from a growth-from-acquisition-focused approach to a 
customer-centric growth-from-retention approach.
As illustrated by BestCo's data in Table 2.1, it would have been 
advantageous for them to initiate this transition as early as 2016 when 
growth from retention started to outpace growth from acquisition.
All of this doesn't mean that acquisition is becoming less important, not at all; 
after all, you can't retain or expand what you haven't acquired. It simply 
highlights that retention is becoming equally important. If you retain your 
customers well, it likely indicates you're focused on helping them succeed with 
your product, which, in turn, enlists them to aid in your growth. This suggests 
that expansion is about to catch up.
The Last Step: Transitioning From Retention to Expansion
By 2022, BestCo had experienced growth from expansion reaching $10.8 million, 
which accounted for 40% of the growth from acquisition, totaling $24.5 million. 
What's more noteworthy is that when we analyze the growth numbers from 
expansion in isolation, we observe a familiar growth pattern: exponential growth. 
While, in the case of BestCo, it will take a few more years, successful companies 
will eventually witness their growth from expansion surpass that from 
acquisition (see Figure 2.3). This is a natural progression; it makes sense that as 
a company continues to grow, it will eventually dominate the market—much like 
Adobe has done with several of its products. At that stage, the company has 
shifted its focus entirely from growth through acquisition to growth from 
expansion, as there are simply no more new customers to acquire.

The exponential growth of the expansion revenue.FIGURE 2.3
In Conclusion
We have observed that growth initially comes from acquisition. However, as the 
graphed data and observations conﬁrm, as the company matures, revenue 
originating from retention makes up the lion’s share of the revenue. 
While acquisition is foundational, ignoring the growing signiﬁcance of retention 
is perilous. By the time a company reaches a critical mass, its Growth Model 
naturally transitions to emphasize both retention and expansion, as exempliﬁed 
by companies like Adobe. 
Now that we understand the origins of growth, let's distill this experience into the 
First Principles for any recurring revenue business.

FIRST PRINCIPLES FOR RECURRING REVENUE
We've just explored the fundamental concepts behind recurring revenue models 
and observed the following:
● Recurring revenue is based on 3 areas of growth: acquisition, retention, 
and expansion.
● Each of these growth areas exhibits a polynomial-shaped growth curve.
● The primary engine driving hypergrowth beyond the initial $10M in ARR 
is a combination of retention and expansion.
With this knowledge we can derive a set of 5 fundamental principles of a 
recurring revenue business that is grounded in scientiﬁc reasoning.
● Principle 1: The growth rate naturally decreases.
● Principle 2: Retention and expansion power growth beyond $10M in ARR. 
● Principle 3: The effects of recurring revenue take time. 
● Principle 4: The risk of the purchase shifts from the buyer to the seller. 
● Principle 5: Recurring revenue is the result of a recurring impact.
We are going to explain each one in detail.
The Growth Rate Naturally Decreases
As companies scale, sustaining a consistent growth rate becomes progressively 
challenging. It's akin to battling gravitational forces; the larger the revenue base, 
the more diﬃcult it is to maintain the same percentage growth. This 
phenomenon doesn't indicate failing strategies but rather represents a natural 
progression observed in many businesses. For a data-driven explanation, please 
refer to Annex B. Consider the scenario depicted in Figure 2.4. The revenue from 
acquisition grows consistently by $2M each year, and the retention rate remains 
unyieldingly at 100%. Yet, even with these constants, the growth rate undergoes 
a noticeable decline. It halves from an initial 100% to 50% and continues to taper 
off as time progresses. 
2.3
PRINCIPLE 1.

## Page 58

C H A P T E R   0 2   |   F I R S T   P R I N C I P L E S
Summary: As a company's revenue increases, maintaining the same percentage 
of growth becomes more challenging. This isn't due to ﬂawed strategies but a 
natural business progression. This natural deceleration in the growth rate is a 
factor businesses must anticipate and strategize for as they mature.
Retention and Expansion Power the Growth Beyond $10M in ARR
Across hundreds of SaaS companies, we observe a familiar growth pattern in the 
growth rate. In the initial 5 years, acquisition plays a signiﬁcant role. In most 
cases, retention follows acquisition with a one-year lag during this period. 
However, around $10M in ARR, retention not only starts to catch up but 
surpasses revenue growth from acquisition, establishing itself as the driving 
force. This follows a hyperbolic growth curve that leads to hypergrowth. As the 
years progress, organizations face an increasing challenge in achieving growth 
through acquisition and become more reliant on growth from expansion, which 
also follows a hyperbolic growth curve. It is common for growth from expansion 
to exceed growth from acquisition around $100M in ARR, this occurs typically 
over 8 years after reaching the ﬁrst million dollars in ARR.
As revenue increases by the same amount, the growth rate naturally declines.FIGURE 2.4

PRINCIPLE 2.
This pattern underscores an important insight: as the amount of total revenue 
climbs, achieving the same percentage growth becomes more challenging. It's 
not just about adding the same dollar amount year after year, but adding a larger 
amount to achieve the same growth rate.

For a Scaleup that may have revenues measured in the hundreds of millions to 
billions of dollars, the above chart can apply to the revenue of a single product, a 
region, a division within the company, or even a single GTM motion.
Summary: In a subscription business, acquisition dominates initial growth. 
However, at around $10M in ARR, retention becomes the primary driver, with 
expansion taking over before reaching $100M in ARR. This makes growth a 
trifecta of acquisition, retention, and expansion:
● Growth is sourced from not 1 but 3 areas: acquisition, retention, and 
expansion.
● Retention and expansion follow a hyperbolic (polynomial) growth curve that 
exceeds that of acquisition in a healthy business.
It is important to note that growth from acquisition depends on the organization 
making a promise to the customer in the form of a value proposition, whereas 
growth from retention and expansion are based on the company delivering on 
the value that was promised, which we will come to know as Impact.
Acquisition and 
Retention appear 
to behave similarly

Running a recurring revenue business requires taking a long-term view. To 
demonstrate this, we will apply the data from Table 2.1 to a set of assumptions:
● Acquisition Cost represents 100% of the revenue acquired in the ﬁrst year, so 
no proﬁt is made in the ﬁrst year.
● Retention Cost amounts to approximately 10% of the revenue retained each 
year, with the cost of expansion being double that of retention, accounting for 
20% of the expanded revenue. 
This scenario provides an overview of the total costs against total revenue, as 
depicted in Figure 2.6 below.
Gross proﬁt increases over time as costs decline, driven by the shift in revenue growth 
towards renewals.
FIGURE 2.6
This illustrates a fundamental principle of a subscription business: as time 
passes, gross proﬁt grows disproportionately. In the initial years, as seen from 
year 2 to year 4 in this example, proﬁts may remain relatively low, but they 
continue to grow signiﬁcantly over time. This underscores the profound impact 
of time. Compare this to a perpetual model where a set amount of proﬁt is 
recorded just days after closing a deal.

This marks the beginning of where the true magic of recurring revenue begins: 
once a customer surpasses its revenue and proﬁt targets, it continues to 
generate a growing stream of revenue that outpaces the associated costs, 
leading to increasing proﬁts over time. In other words, as revenue continues to 
accelerate, so do the proﬁts. These proﬁts enable a company to maintain 
momentum through new product development, acquisitions, and increased 
spending on marketing and sales. It reﬂects the true power of the recurring 
revenue factory at work.
What Happens If You Assign Sales to Renewals and Expansions?
Success comes with its own set of challenges. A business built on a recurring 
revenue model is sensitive to even the slightest changes, be they positive or 
negative. To illustrate this point, let's consider a scenario where we assign the 
revenue acquisition team (the sales team) to handle expansions, and renewals 
for large deals. In this scenario, we assume that the acquisition cost remains at 
100% of the revenue acquired, causing the cost of expansion to match the cost 
of acquisition. Additionally, we increase the retention cost to 20% of the revenue 
retained, as sellers selectively focus on securing the largest renewal deals. 
Early on, the 
behavior of both 
scenarios is similar.

The Delicate Nature of a Subscription Business
Figure 2.7 reveals the signiﬁcant drop in proﬁts, a result of the increasing rise in 
costs. In the second and third years, there is minimal difference in costs. 
However, as customers mature, costs skyrocket, signiﬁcantly impacting proﬁts. 
This scenario serves as a stark reminder of the delicate nature of the recurring 
revenue model and underscores the importance of carefully managing the costs 
and strategies involved. These skyrocketing costs are not merely a temporary 
phase that companies go through. 
In fact, at the beginning of 2023, a lionshare of all public SaaS companies, many 
of which had revenues measured in the hundreds of millions to billions of dollars 
in revenue, reported in their annual statements that they allocated more than 
40% of their revenue to cover the cost of marketing and sales, and that this cost 
was increasing.
A Long-Term Impact of Short-Term Thinking
This demonstrates the adverse effects of decisions that are based on a 
misunderstanding of how the recurring revenue factory works and operating it 
as if it were a perpetual software business. The negative effects are often 
self-inﬂicted and directly tied to the short tenure of revenue leadership positions. 
For instance, when a newly assigned chief revenue oﬃcer (CRO) aims to achieve 
growth targets and secure their bonus, they may opt to reassign sales 
responsibilities to handle all renewals and expansions, taking responsibilities 
away from the customer success team. The decision to hit a short-term growth 
target will have a detrimental impact on the customer lifetime value of 
thousands of accounts, leading to long-term consequences for proﬁtability.
Summary: The real ﬁnancial beneﬁt of a recurring revenue model aren't 
immediate; it takes time, measured in years. It requires patience and strategic 
cost management. A slight mismanagement aimed to have a short-term impact 
can have signiﬁcant consequences for proﬁtability.

Recurring Revenue Shifts the Risk From the Buyer to the Seller
Up to this point, we have witnessed several shifts throughout the transition from 
an upfront-payment revenue model to a recurring revenue model. One of the 
most signiﬁcant changes we have yet to address is the seismic risk shift in the 
purchase process: as the revenue model changes from ownership-based to 
subscription-based, the risk of the purchase shifts from the buyer to the seller.
Low
Risk
High
Buyer Seller SellerBuyerPlaces the burden of risk 
squarely on the buyer's 
shoulders in their pursuit 
of achieving impact. This 
gave rise to support 
contracts and 
involvement of system 
integrators.
In SaaS, it is the seller 
who takes on all the risk 
to deliver impact. 
Processes around 
managing risks have not 
changed, for example, 
buyers today still expect a 
20% discount.
Risk
Let’s go back to the year 2000 when a buyer purchased $10 million worth of 
internet routers; they paid for them up front. Products were typically built on 
demand by the seller and shipped to the customer's location. Legally, the buyer 
assumed all of the risk from the moment the equipment was picked up by the 
shipper. The buyer had to unpack, install, and operate the routers within their 
network. Since the buyer paid up front, any issues that arose were the buyer's 
responsibility. In fact, they had to pay an additional 20% fee for a maintenance 
and support contract.
Compare this to a subscription business, in which it is the seller who takes on 
most of the responsibility up front. This includes investing in infrastructure long 
before they even start generating revenue. Additionally, the seller must provide 
updates, maintenance, and support throughout the customer's subscription. It's 
a signiﬁcant shift from the perpetual model, where a seller's proﬁt came right 
after a sale, to a subscription-based model where proﬁtability is achieved over 
years as customers renew, and the seller fulﬁlls its commitments.
In a subscription business the risk of the deal sifts from the buyer to the seller.FIGURE 2.8

Trends Driven by Customer-Centric Behavior
As previously discussed, the nature of SaaS revenue, which is received 
incrementally on a monthly or annual basis, requires a signiﬁcant amount of 
time, often 1 to 2 years or even longer, to recoup the acquisition costs and 
achieve the desired proﬁt margins for the business. Consequently, early 
customer churn becomes a substantial risk. To mitigate this risk, providers must 
foster customer-centric behavior, encouraging customers to renew their 
subscriptions repeatedly. This involves fulﬁlling the promises made during the 
initial acquisition (sales) process, thereby establishing a long-term relationship 
with customers. This may help explain 2 recent trends:
● Trend 1. Quality-based over quantity-based outreach programs: 
Organizations focus on determining early on, in the lead generation process, 
if the targeted customer can actually achieve the desired impact and has 
potential for expansion.
● Trend 2. Product-led growth (PLG): With PLG, customers are self qualifying 
based on the impact they obtain early on. 
Summary: Transitioning from upfront to subscription payment models shifts 
purchase risk from buyer to seller. This demands a customer-centric approach 
with a long-term relationship focus.
Recurring Revenue is the Result of Recurring Impact
When it comes to thinking about a subscription-based business, many people 
make a twofold mistake: ﬁrst, they believe it's solely about generating recurring 
revenue, and second, they assume growth primarily comes from acquiring more 
customers.
So far, you have learned that recurring revenue growth is an outcome of growth 
from acquisition, retention, and expansion. Most of this growth comes from 
customers returning to you yearly or monthly to renew and expand their 
relationship with your product. They would not do that if it were not for the 
impact they receive from your products and services. Let's take Netﬂix as an 
example we are all familiar with.
PRINCIPLE 5.

## Page 65

C H A P T E R   0 2   |   F I R S T   P R I N C I P L E S 65
If Netﬂix wants to generate recurring revenue from its customers, it must provide 
something valuable regularly and consistently. In the case of Netﬂix, that 
something is new content. If Netﬂix were to stop delivering fresh content to its 
audience, people would stop paying for the service within months, right? I mean, 
as a Netﬂix customer, you expect new content monthly in exchange for your 
monthly payment. If you, as a customer, do not perceive that you are getting 
fresh content consistently, you will stop paying. It's really that simple.
This example emphasizes the core concept of recurring revenue: to maintain it, 
you must consistently deliver the impact that customers anticipate from your 
products and services. If you fail to provide this impact, it's only natural for 
customers to cease their recurring payments. Or, in simpler terms, Recurring 
Revenue is the outcome of Recurring Impact.
Summary: Continual revenue relies on consistent delivery of value. Businesses 
must regularly provide impactful products and services to ensure customer 
loyalty and recurring revenue.

EXERCISES FOR FIRST PRINCIPLES
Obtain a Data Set
Obtain the recurring revenue numbers and split them into 3 components of 
growth. Enter this in a spreadsheet similar to the one depicted in the table below. 
Do this over a minimum of 8 periods. The period can be a month, a quarter, or a 
year. For a product with longer sales cycles, your period should be longer, like 
quarters; for products with short sales cycles, your periods should be shorter, 
like months.

Add a Trendline
If you are using Google Sheets, click on 1 of the 3 series, and add a trendline. 
Next, check the R2 box, which indicates how accurately the trendline follows the 
data. Choose the type of trendline, such as linear, exponential, polynomial, etc. 
that results in an R2 value as close as possible to 1. A 2nd or 3rd-degree 
polynomial trendline usually yields the best results, with an R2 value around 0.98 
or higher. Repeat this process for each series.
Gain an Understanding
Study the trendline, and answer the following questions:
● Question 1: Where is most of the growth coming from today?
● Question 2: When will growth from retention exceed growth from 
acquisition?
● Question 3: When will growth from expansion exceed growth from 
acquisition?
By completing these simple exercises, you now better understand where growth 
currently originates from and where it is trending.

RECAP FIRST PRINCIPLES
There are 3 key takeaways from this chapter:
● Takeaway #1: Growth in a recurring revenue model has 3 components: 
Growth from Acquisition (bringing in new customers), Growth from 
Retention (renewing contracts with existing customers), and Growth from 
Expansion (selling more to existing customers). Each component exhibits a 
different growth curve that can be used to model future growth.
● Takeaway #2: There are 4 stages of growth (see Figure 2.10). Initially, growth 
comes from acquisition ①; around $10M in ARR, it comes from retention ②, 
which forms the basis of exponential growth. Eventually, growth from 
expansion ③ exceeds growth from acquisition. Lastly, extending the 
customer lifetime provides a disproportionate amount of proﬁt ④.
● Takeaway #3: Growth from acquisition depends on the organization 
promising value, whereas growth from retention and expansion are based on 
the company delivering on the value that was promised, which we have 
come to know as Impact.

The recurring revenue factory is built around a high-performance engine, 
the power of which remains largely underutilized because we often don’t 
understand how it works. By harnessing ﬁrst principles thinking, we stripped 
down this complex topic to its foundational truths, and are able to model 
scalable, sustainable and durable growth, a topic discussed in the next chapter.
This is based on the following First Principles. 
Understanding these principles of recurring revenue is essential for any 
executive. It will help them make informed and strategic decisions to navigate 
the rapidly shifting tides of the industry.
Principle 1: Growth rates will taper off naturally. 
Principle 2: Retention and expansion power growth beyond $10M in ARR. 
Principle 3: The effects of recurring revenue take time. 
Principle 4: The risk of a purchase shifts from the buyer to the seller. 
Principle 5: Recurring revenue is the result of a recurring impact.

The technological miracle that occurred during the start of 2020 saw over a 
billion people utilize cloud-based applications, with relatively few infrastructure 
issues. In this chapter, you will learn where things broke and how to ﬁx them. 
We will employ a scientiﬁc approach called "models & data," which builds on 
the insights derived from ﬁrst principle thinking discussed in the previous 
chapter: that growth comes from acquisition, retention, and expansion.
Next, we are going to approach growth using a series of models. Models 
are simpliﬁed representations of a lot of data. They are to interpret, predict, or 
explain the data from real-world GTM phenomena. In essence, while data offers 
the raw information, models provide the tools to understand and utilize that 
information effectively.
It is Time to Think Beyond Trends
The past years have shown that mindlessly following popular GTM trends 
promoted at conferences and online workshops rarely works. Just because 
a particular approach worked elsewhere doesn't mean it will work for your 
business. Worse, each new approach comes with its own tools, content, and 
unfamiliar disciplines, making it costly and time-consuming. This chapter 
teaches you how to leverage models before implementing the latest trends. 
Ask yourself: What worked? What didn't? And will it work for us?

Leveraging Models for GTM Success
Drawing inspiration from Scott Page's book, The Model Thinker, we'll explore 
the world of modeling behavior to unlock the full potential of recurring revenue 
growth. You will learn that models have revolutionized various ﬁelds for 
hundreds of years, and now it's time for GTM teams to use them to unlock 
the full potential of recurring revenue growth. In the end, you will have learned 
about the 6 essential models governing recurring revenue and how they are 
combined to create a recurring revenue system.
MODELS EXPLAINED
You may wonder how models work and how to apply them to growing 
recurring revenue. In short: we use models to capture scientiﬁc observations and 
transform them into practical frameworks, much like blueprints. Now, before the 
term "science" has you anticipating terminology-heavy explanations or intricate 
equations, let's pull back the curtain a bit. Science, at its core, is the study of our 
natural world. It fuels our curiosity about how our world works, reminiscent of 
our childhood days when we probed, explored, and questioned.
Models are Neither 100% Accurate Nor 100% Complete 
While models aren't perfect representations of reality, well-designed models can 
encapsulate the experiences of thousands of data points. They are a powerful 
tool for understanding, explaining, and predicting phenomena. We see the results 
of modeling all around us: in architecture, where models help design buildings 
and structures with precision, and in the medical ﬁeld, where models aid in 
predicting disease outcomes and treatment effectiveness. 
Models are simpliﬁed representations of reality; they explain and predict the 
behavior of something we see today. However, models, by deﬁnition, are 
incomplete and thus not 100% accurate. Models are based on data and 
simpliﬁcations, and they have limitations due to their ﬁnite nature compared to 
the inﬁnite complexity of the real world. We can improve the accuracy of a

model by combining it with other models. Next, we will present examples of 
other disciplines that have used models. This will help us construct a holistic 
and robust framework for recurring revenue growth. 
Example 1: Civil Engineering – Dividing a Structure into Models
Models are fundamental in the ﬁeld of civil engineering. For thousands of 
years, civil engineers have been tasked with designing structures like bridges 
that must function reliably 100% of the time and endure for as long as 100 years. 
Take the Golden Gate Bridge as an example. As described in the Preface, this 
iconic structure is one of the world's largest suspension bridges. Its design 
addresses the strong winds and seismic activity prevalent in the area. How can a 
bridge designed in 1935—built as the "largest ever"—work safely, function 
properly, and last this long? Because they used modeling.

Towers
Piers
Anchors
Suspension cablesMain cable
Deck
The design of a suspension bridge can be broken down into 6 components.FIGURE 3.1
Every suspension bridge consists of the same 6 components, assembled in the 
same way each time: The towers are built on piers. A main cable is strung over 
the top of the towers and between 2 heavily fortiﬁed anchors. From the main 
cable, the deck is suspended through a series of suspension cables.
Engineers have mathematical models for each of these 6 components, scaling 
them up or down and combining them to simulate how the system responds 
under varying circumstances. They then build a prototype to stress test 
individual components or the design as a whole in a real-life scenario.

Models Can Bridge Knowledge Gaps
The modeling approach was particularly useful for building the Golden 
Gate Bridge, as it allowed engineers to capture all available knowledge up 
to that point. Once the model was veriﬁed, adjustments could be made to 
match requirements unique to the location. By connecting models of individual 
components, engineers could create a simulation, allowing for different 
scenarios to be tested. For example, if the towers increase in height, the main 
cable must be thicker. Today, 90 years after its original design, the Golden Gate 
Bridge remains one of the world's most iconic bridges, largely thanks to 
modeling. 
Example 2: Human Anatomy – A Case for Combining Models
Let’s take a closer look at human anatomy and the use of models. The skeletal 
system represents the bone structure common to nearly all humans. Similarly, 
the muscular model showcases our muscle layout. Each model offers a unique 
view, but neither provides a complete understanding of human movement. Only 
when we combine the skeletal, nervous, and muscular models do we gain an 
understanding how humans move.
Skeletal Model
Muscular Model
Cardiovascular Model
● The human anatomy can be 
described by a series of models. 
● Each model is 100% accurate.
● A single model does not provide 
an accurate picture of how a 
human as a whole works.
● Different models provide a 
different perspective.
● Combining models increases the 
accuracy.
● It takes multiple models to 
create an accurate picture of 
how the human body works.

C H A P T E R   0 3   |   M O D E L S   A N D   D A T A
Combining Models Increases Accuracy
This human anatomy example shows that although a single model may not 
provide a complete picture, combining models gives us a more precise 
understanding. The same is true for a recurring revenue system; a single model, 
such as the Growth Model, may not accurately represent how recurring revenue 
growth works. However, combining this with the GTM model provides us with a 
more accurate picture.
Moving forward, combining multiple models will give us a more accurate overall 
picture that can help us make informed decisions, test hypotheses, and increase 
our understanding of the inner workings of a recurring revenue system. But 
models can do more—much more. They can help us better understand how 
things work and provide a framework to engage in conversations across 
languages and cultural barriers.
Next, we are going to introduce you to 6 models to set the stage. Each of these 
models will be detailed in Part II and Part III.
THE SIX ESSENTIAL MODELS
Now that you understand how modeling works, we'll use this knowledge to 
construct a scalable, sustainable, and durable recurring revenue engine. As 
discussed in the previous chapter, recurring revenue growth consists of 3 
components—acquisition, retention, and expansion—with the GTM team 
responsible for designing, building, and operationalizing the necessary systems 
and processes.
And this is where Revenue Architecture comes in: similar to our earlier examples 
with the bridge and human body, we'll ﬁrst break down the GTM operation into 
essential parts. Then, we'll use models to simulate each part's functionality. 
Finally, we'll combine these models to simulate the entire system before 
deploying a solution in the ﬁeld using systems and processes.

Let’s provide an overview of each of the 6 essential models.
Model 1. Revenue Model
The Revenue Model identiﬁes 3 distinct monetization strategies: ownership, 
subscription, and consumption. Each of these strategies hinges on a unique 
revenue model based on a different ﬁrst principle: 
● Ownership is reliant on upfront payments. This model is typically seen 
with perpetual software licenses and on-premise hardware sales.
● Subscription is based on periodic payments, commonly associated 
with subscription-based services like SaaS.
● Consumption revolves around payments that correspond to the amount 
consumed. This approach is found in ride-sharing platforms such as Uber 
or Lyft, where users are charged based on the duration of their trip.
And herein lies the problem: most recurring revenue businesses still operate on 
an ownership-based model with a perpetual software monetization strategy. 
Based on working with over a thousand SaaS companies, and with thousands of 
revenue leaders we have distilled the recurring revenue factory into 6 essential 
models: The Revenue Model, The Data Model, The Mathematical Model, The 
Operating Model, The Growth Model, and the GTM Model.

Model 2. Data Model
For the past 100 years, we have used the marketing and sales funnel to capture 
growth from acquisition. However, growth from both retention and expansion 
falls outside the purview of the marketing and sales funnel. The funnel stops 
where recurring revenue begins. 
We are introducing a new Data Model that spans the entire customer journey. It 
leverages the existing funnel but extends to provide equal emphasis on the 
stages leading to Retention and Expansion, in addition to those leading to 
Acquisition. This is visualized as a Bowtie. By superimposing a uniform layer of 
metrics, it creates a standardized Data Model. These metrics are categorized as 
follows:
● Volume metrics can include the number of leads, the amount of 
monthly recurring revenue (MRR), and the number of active seats.
● Conversion metrics can include lead conversion rate, win rate, 
and net revenue retention (NRR).
● Time metrics include the sales cycle, time to ﬁrst impact, and the 
customer's lifetime, but can expand to more detailed metrics involving 
the time it takes to set up a demo instance, for example.
● Performance metrics combine different metrics, such as a volume 
metric vs. a conversion metric, the number of leads vs. win rate, or 
the performance per rep. Performance metrics become powerful when 
you compare 2 conversion metrics against each other, such as win 
rate vs. churn. 
The Foundation for AI-Driven Revenue Architecture
Establishing a standardized data model and a data structure is essential for 
effectively utilizing AI's capabilities and achieving optimal results in terms of 
growth, cost reduction, and customer impact. While those lagging behind may 
limit their AI applications to speciﬁc tasks, industry leaders will use Revenue 
Architecture to set up the data model and structure as their initial step.

C H A P T E R   0 3   |   M O D E L S   A N D   D A T A
Model 3. Mathematical Model
When asked how to double their revenue, many revenue leaders instinctively 
respond by requesting twice as many leads and insisting on doubling the size of 
their team to engage with the additional leads. This direct, linear approach 
sharply contrasts with the inherently exponential nature of recurring revenue 
growth. Because of the nonlinear characteristics of exponential growth, 
businesses utilizing a recurring revenue model are highly sensitive to even 
marginal gains or losses.
The Mathematical Model provides us with a universal language that underpins 
much of our scientiﬁc and technological advancements. The mathematics of a 
recurring revenue engine can be broken down into 2 distinct parts:
● Part 1. Acquisition: Here, growth is driven by the repetition, or frequency of 
tasks. Each task can inﬂuence subsequent tasks. For example, meetings, in 
which one meeting inﬂuences the outcome of the next meeting.
● Part 2. Retention and Expansion: In this case, growth is directly tied to 
repetition over time. An example is an annual increase in price, which 
compounds over time.
Understanding the nuance of how recurring revenue-based growth engines work 
is a crucial differentiator between merely surviving and truly thriving.
Model 4. Operating Model
Success in a recurring revenue model relies on various customer-facing roles 
working together eﬃciently as a cohesive system, which can be facilitated by 
implementing an operating model. This model helps ensure that different 
functions within the organization align their efforts to support recurring revenue 
growth effectively. Moreover, the lack of a uniﬁed approach across a diversity of 
GTM motions has resulted in the use of mismatched tools and conﬂicting 
methodologies. Additionally, it has at times led to bad hiring decisions that place 
individuals in roles not best suited to their skills or experience. Such 
misalignments not only drive up costs but, more importantly, cause delays.
78

## Page 79

C H A P T E R   0 3   |   M O D E L S   A N D   D A T A
The Operating Model is built upon 3 core elements:
1. Establish a standardized Data Model: Drawing upon the metrics and 
details outlined in Model 2, and referred to as the Bowtie.
2. Adopt a common language: A consistent vocabulary across all GTM roles, 
aimed at helping a customer achieve the desired impact.
3. Implement a uniform methodology: Create seamless communication 
throughout the entirety of the customer journey.
The Operating Model aims to foster seamless interaction both within an 
individual GTM motion as well as collectively across multiple GTM motions. This 
seamless interaction becomes paramount, especially for Scaleups and 
Grownups that, propelled by their growth ambitions, are required to swiftly 
diversify and launch multiple GTM motions.
Model 5. Growth Model
A thriving recurring revenue business progresses through 4 distinct stages:
● Startup: With revenue ranging from $1M to $10M, this stage 
often sees an early stage funding round (A/B round).
● Scaleup: Here, revenue grows from $10M to $500M, it is typically 
accompanied by a late stage funding round (C/D/E/PE round) and is the 
result of revenue from multiple products and different GTM motions.
● Grownup: This post-IPO/PE stage witnesses revenues climbing to a billion 
dollars and requires a phase shift from a growth focus to a focus on proﬁt. 
● Enterprise: This is the zenith where a public SaaS company exceeds $1B in 
revenue for each of its product lines. 
Each stage heralds a phase shift characterized by distinct initiatives, 
stakeholders, performance metrics, and resource assignments. As we delve 
deeper, you'll gain insight into the intricacies of these growth stages. Mastering 
how to understand and adeptly navigate these stages empowers GTM teams to 
carve out a clear roadmap toward scalable, sustainable, and durable growth.

Model 6. The GTM Model
The GTM Model combines the efforts of all functions interacting with 
customers, encompassing marketing, sales, and customer success. It 
comprises people, systems, and tools. The GTM Model can include various GTM 
motions. While different names exist for GTM motions, we have standardized 
them based on process complexity:
● No Touch: Customers are used to marketing, selling, and servicing the 
product.
● Low Touch: Primarily uses AI with personal engagement for complex 
situations.
● Medium Touch: Involves a sales development representative (SDR) who 
qualiﬁes customers and then hands them off to an AE.
● High Touch: AMs manage large accounts, often with technical 
assistance from a sales engineer or solutions architect.
● Dedicated Touch: A team focused on one large (F500) account. This can be 
managed by an executive who runs a large group and 
reports directly to the CEO.
Note that each GTM motion can have a channel and a direct option. The lack of 
understanding about how the GTM Model works often leads to costly mistakes, 
such as selecting the wrong GTM motion, implementing the right one incorrectly, 
or inadvertently mixing multiple GTM motions. These mistakes can be 
particularly costly due to the involvement of personnel.
Summary of the Six Essential Models
Now that you have an understanding of all 6 of the essential models, it's 
important to recognize that they don't operate in isolation. Instead, they interact 
with each other in a speciﬁc way, forming a structure to which there is a 
hierarchy. Let's delve into the structure of these models in the next paragraph.

STRUCTURE OF THE MODELS 
There is a hierarchy to the 6 essential models.They are structured like layers 
sitting on top of each other, with the most fundamental model, the Revenue 
Model, forming the base. This is not a surprise as the Revenue Model outlines 
how a business expects to generate revenue growth, affecting all the models 
layered on top. Revenue Architecture is the discipline that ensures that each 
model has been appropriately designed, that they are structured in the correct 
order, and that all models interact correctly with each other.
The Structural Hierarchy of the Six Essential Models
Each model interacts with those above and below it. The models at the bottom 
of the structure (Models 1 to 3) are more static, meaning they are unlikely to 
change frequently. For instance, you wouldn't want to switch away from a 
subscription-based Revenue Model overnight or modify your Data Model often.

In contrast, the models higher up in the structure (Models 4 to 6) are dynamic, 
allowing for frequent changes to the GTM Model. For example, many companies 
launch a new GTM motion every few years.
Today, when a business launches a new GTM motion, it can be done at will by an 
individual revenue leader, who may not be fully aware of the widespread impacts. 
When a business launches a new GTM motion, someone disciplined in Revenue 
Architecture should ﬁrst review the consequences on each of the 6 essential 
models, starting at Model 1 and working their way up layer by layer.
At the top, we ﬁnd the GTM model, which consists of multiple GTM motions. 
This is the only model with which humans physically interact through tangible 
actions. Each model interfaces with the others layered above and below.
The Organization of Data
The layered approach now enables us to structure data, with each layer serving a 
speciﬁc purpose and interacting with other layers through data to fulﬁll that 
purpose (see Figure 3.5).
Let's break it down, starting from the top with the addressable market: we utilize 
a GTM motion to generate revenue from the targeted market against a cost. This 
cost can take various forms, including advertising campaigns, salespeople, tools, 
and more, all contributing to scalable growth. In this context, scalable growth 
means that the more resources we invest, the more we scale the revenue. This 
leads to an increase in the growth rate, but it also comes with higher costs that 
affect the proﬁt margin, thus impact sustainability.
The past few years have taught us on the importance of the cost of growth and 
striving for sustainable growth. Sustainability, in this context, means that costs 
like CAC and CTS are on a downward trend. To achieve this, we must rely on 
performance metrics like revenue and revenue/GTM motion. This approach 
ensures that the organization makes wise investments in growth where its 
investments yield the highest reward.

When we examine the CAC/CTS metrics more closely, we quickly discover that 
the most effective and sustainable growth stems from self-perpetuating growth. 
In this scenario, new customers are drawn in through referrals from existing 
customers, and existing customers not only renew but also expand their 
engagement with the business. This is a reﬂection of having the right customers, 
which creates durable growth.
Informed Decisions
The "3 Es" (Effectiveness, Eﬃciency, Economy) are used for evaluating and 
improving various aspects of an organization's operations, processes, and 
decision-making. Here's how each of them is typically applied:

● Effectiveness: The degree to which goals and objectives are achieved using 
a speciﬁc GTM motion(s). This is where you ﬁnd Scalable Growth.
● Eﬃciency: The ability to achieve goals with minimal wasted resources (e.g., 
time, money, or effort). This is where you ﬁnd capital-eﬃcient and 
sustainable growth.
● Economy: The optimization of resource utilization to achieve desired 
outcomes in a cost-effective manner. This is where you ﬁnd quality metrics 
such as Productivity (quality metric for performance) and Impact (quality 
metric for a product's ability to deliver recurring results.
In practice, the 3 Es are often used together to make informed decisions and 
improvements. For example, an organization might assess the effectiveness of 
its marketing campaign by examining whether it achieved its intended results 
(Effectiveness). It could then analyze how eﬃciently it used its marketing budget 
to reach those results (Eﬃciency). Finally, it might consider whether there are 
more economical ways to achieve the same outcomes without increasing costs 
(Economy). The 3 Es provide a framework for organizations to evaluate, 
optimize, and balance their performance in a way that aligns with their goals and 
resources.
Evidence Based Decision-Making
In scientiﬁc research, engineering, and economics, the dynamic interplay 
between ﬁrst principles, data, and mathematics is essential for understanding, 
explaining, and predicting complex systems and phenomena. First Principles 
serve as the foundational building blocks upon which theories, models, and 
hypotheses are constructed, providing the crucial theoretical framework that 
guides scientiﬁc and analytical investigations. Data, in contrast, represents 
empirical evidence collected from the real world, serving as the practical link 
connecting ﬁrst principles and data. Mathematical models, derived from these 
ﬁrst principles, facilitate the analysis and comprehension of data, allowing for 
predictions and reﬁnement of theoretical frameworks. This synergy drives 
evidence-based decision-making and signiﬁcantly enhances our ability to tackle 
intricate real-world challenges like the ones we are dealing with.

Scalable, Sustainable and Durable Growth
To build a durable growth engine, organizations must go from driving the 
business based on "gut feeling" to making informed and evidence-based 
decisions. Despite notable progress in this area, even the most advanced 
organizations continue to struggle with relatively immature Data Models, making 
the pursuit of scalable, sustainable, and durable growth challenging.

3.5 RECAP MODELS
Just as civil engineers use models to design and test the reliability of structures 
like bridges, business leaders can rely on these 6 essential models to design, 
prototype, and test the reliability of a recurring revenue factory.
These models interact, creating a layered structure with static models at the 
base and dynamic models at the top. Individually, each model serves as an 
insightful framework, but together, they form a structure that demystiﬁes the 
intricacies of a recurring revenue system. This aids GTM teams in understanding 
how a recurring revenue–based growth engine functions and clariﬁes their roles 
within it.

Additionally, it assists organizations in anticipating how changes to their 
systems and processes can impact growth, enabling informed, evidence-based 
decisions on fund allocation for growth.
While these 6 essential models can't turn an underperforming product into a 
blockbuster service, they do illuminate a path to success, helping navigate 
around obstacles that have tripped up countless others. This doesn't guarantee 
a smooth journey; companies will still encounter challenges—it's part of the 
process. However, these challenges should primarily arise from product issues, 
while failure due to choosing the wrong GTM motion, executing a poorly 
designed process, or hiring the wrong person for the job should be minimized.
In the following chapters, we will delve deeply into each of these models to 
develop a clear understanding of how your business operates and how it 
responds to your operational decisions. Along the way, you'll frequently 
experience 'Aha' moments, gaining insights into why things succeeded or failed 
in the past.

Like any factory, the Recurring Revenue Factory operates on systems and 
processes. This chapter delves into the systems and processes that govern a 
recurring revenue factory and that deliver recurring impact, causing eﬃcient 
growth.
In the ﬁrst part of this chapter, we will explore systems. We will learn that the 
marketing and sales funnel is a system that was designed to acquire perpetual 
revenue. The generation of recurring revenue falls outside the purview of the 
marketing and sales funnel. This tells us that to succeed, organizations must 
adopt a new system that encompasses not only the acquisition of revenue but, 
importantly, the retention and expansion—the sources of recurring revenue, as 
discussed in the chapter on ﬁrst principles. You will come to know this recurring 
revenue system by its nickname: the Bowtie.
In the second part of this chapter, we will explore processes. The critical point 
here is that most organizations are people-centric. Such organizations scale 
their businesses through staﬃng; you can recognize this as they hire more 
people when things go well, and when issues arise, they are quick to blame and 
ﬁre employees. This often coincides with an opinion-based culture. In contrast, a 
process-centric organization, whether the results are favorable or not, prioritizes 
the scrutiny of underlying processes from a data-centric perspective. This 
coincides with a causality-based culture.

These systems and processes are applied to help achieve the 3 goals of a 
revenue factory:
● Achieve Growth: By utilizing closed-loop systems.
● Lower Costs: Use of iterative improvements of processes, accomplished via 
the use of technology, use of ordinary people, or a combination of both.
● Recurring Impact: Emphasis on the impact delivered, not the product itself.
Having set the stage, let's begin by understanding the recurring revenue factory, 
the Bowtie, and why it is so critical to a recurring revenue stream.
SYSTEMS EXPLAINED
A system is simply a set of interconnected business functions that work 
together to achieve a speciﬁc goal. You're likely already familiar with the 
marketing and sales funnel. Well, the marketing and sales funnel is, in fact, a 
revenue acquisition system designed to convert prospects into perpetual 
revenue. Historically, it relied on functions like lead generation and lead 
development to drive growth. By exploring the limitations of the marketing and 
sales funnel, we will identify missing elements from which we will construct a 
new system, purpose-built for recurring revenue, called the Bowtie.
The Marketing and Sales Funnel
The classic marketing and sales funnel functions as a revenue acquisition 
system. It comprises 3 sub-systems, commonly referred to as stages. Ideally, 
the top-of-the-funnel (TOFU) is rich with prospects, indicating a substantial and 
accessible market. These prospects engage with content designed to raise 
awareness of potential problems (Leads). Subsequently, they receive education 
on various problem-solving approaches (Opportunities). As they progress 
through the funnel, they reach a decision point where they select the right 
solution for their needs. For the seller this results in a closed deal, securing 
revenue and the acquisition of a new customer (Closed/Won).

The classic marketing and sales funnel functions as a revenue acquisition system 
consisting of 4 sub-systems, with the fourth being the funnel as a whole.
FIGURE 4.1
● Sub-System 1. Awareness: Utilizes a series of touchpoints to transform 
prospects into leads by raising awareness around a problem the prospect is 
experiencing and the implications of inaction on their business. These 
touchpoints can encompass activities like ﬁlling out a form on a website, 
downloading content, attending online events like workshops, or watching 
demo videos. In this context, a lead refers to an individual interested in your 
products or services. At the end of the lead generation process, you 
unsurprisingly end up with... leads. 
Leads differ from prospects in that they have expressed interest in 
some way, deﬁned slightly differently for each company. It could be 
attending a webinar, download a research paper, comment on a post, or as 
simple as an inbound request via the website. You have a way to contact 
them through email, social media, or phone. However, it's crucial to note that 
although they may have attended a workshop or watched a video, they may 
still not be ready to learn more about your offering.

● Sub-System 2. Education: In this stage, the customer educates themselves 
with insights into the problem and solution. The goal of this process is to 
fully understand the impact of the product and determine its priority. This 
conversion turns a lead into a qualiﬁed opportunity. The conversion into a 
qualiﬁed opportunity depends on the GTM motion. 
In a Medium Touch motion, for example, a Development Representative 
(SDR) may engage with the lead, qualifying them through conversations, 
which can occur via a call, email, or LinkedIn message. The most common 
approach for a buyer is through either a self-serve demo (or video) or an 
online discovery call, during which a salesperson assesses the customer's 
issue, determines the urgency with which the customer views it, and 
evaluates the ability of their product to assist the customer effectively.
● Sub-System 3. Selection: This guides customers through a decision- making 
and purchasing process. It can be as simple as providing a link to a webpage 
for placing an order, or it can involve a series of meetings spread across a 
months-long decision process where the seller works closely with the 
customer to answer questions and address the customer's needs. 
Selection often includes educating stakeholders throughout the buyer's 
organization. This may include, conducting a proof of concept (POC), to help 
validate the decision with a proposal that presents the return on investment 
(ROI). In an ownership-based strategy, the seller closes the deal, and the 
customer transfers the money to the seller within 30 days after closing, 
converting the opportunity into revenue.
This classic approach concludes with the seller marking the deal as "Closed" in 
their CRM and moving on to the next opportunity. This is a proven process that 
has served B2B organizations well. However, it's essential to recognize that this 
process was designed over a century ago. It has since been used extensively for 
on-premise hardware sales and, more recently, perpetual software sales. Let's 
not forget that recurring revenue has distinct characteristics, and therefore 
encounters the limitations of the marketing and sales funnel.

● Sub-System 4. The Acquisition System: There is one more system that 
comes into play, namely, the combination of the the 3 individual sub-systems 
which collectively form a revenue acquisition system. This acquisition 
system operates as its own system with its own characteristics.
The metrics of the acquisition system are ARR growth, the rate of Growth, 
and acquisition cost (CAC), for example. This is where the problem with 
growth at all costs incurred.
By acknowledging the existence of an overarching acquisition system that 
interconnects the 3 sub-systems, you'll gain a clear understanding of the 
constraints.
The Constraints of the Marketing and Sales Funnel
As we build a new system to cover the whole revenue stream, we must 
take a closer look at the constraints of the classic marketing and sales 
funnel affecting recurring revenue, in order to overcome them.
● The funnel does not cover recurring revenue: To state the obvious, 
2 out of 3 revenue growth engines (retention and expansion) are taking place 
outside the purview of the funnel. Currently, recurring revenue, revenue 
growth, and proﬁts all take place outside the purview of the marketing and 
sales funnel. The classic marketing and sales funnel, which has served our 
industry for over 100 years, ends where recurring revenue begins.
● The funnel is seller-centric: A seller-centric funnel focuses on closing deals 
by promising the value of a solution. Recurring revenue focuses, by 
deﬁnition, on what the product does for the customer: Impact. This 
seller-centric approach can be found all too often in organizations with a 
maniacal focus on winning more deals, creating an insatiable hunger for 
(more) leads. It is challenging for a company to outgrow this mindset, and all 
too often, it comes down to a refresh of the leadership team.

?
● Operators act as if the funnel functions linearly: When faced with a demand 
to double the revenue, revenue leaders frequently respond by urging the 
organization to generate twice as many leads as though the funnel operates 
linearly. This reﬂects a common misperception of a linear relationship 
between leads, opportunities, deals, and revenue.
● The funnel does not consider closed loops: Similar to being one-directional, 
the funnel also does not show the presence of feedback loops.
These constraints amplify each other, further bolstering the wrong behavior, 
and today, many companies deal with the daily issues caused unintentionally 
by boundaries the classic marketing and sales funnel has imposed on them.

The Bowtie, A Custom Built System for Recurring Revenue
With the rise of subscription-based businesses in the early 2000s and the 
growing emphasis on recurring revenue models post-2008, revenue recognition 
underwent a dramatic shift. In contrast to the ownership-based approach that 
prevailed for most of its lifetime (L TV)—where revenue was recognized upon 
shipment of equipment or emailing of the "software license," often occurring 
within 30 days of the Purchase Order—the subscription model operates 
differently. In this model, only a small portion of the fees is booked upon the 
deal's closure, with the full revenue often taking years to materialize. 
In early 2020, we engaged with a client preparing for an IPO, boasting 
a recurring revenue stream of $200M ARR. The CRO ran monthly 
90-minute meetings with all revenue leaders, maintaining a tight ship 
for cross-departmental alignment. To facilitate this alignment, the 
CRO's oﬃce circulated a 50-slide deck containing key metrics for every 
business segment, focusing on growth patterns from acquisition, 
retention, and expansion.
The meeting structure mirrored the business ﬂow, starting with leads 
generated per campaign, quality of leads, win rates, discount levels, 
and eventually discussing the number of sales reps on quota, etc. 
However, a noticeable pattern emerged: approximately 85 of the 90 
minutes were dedicated to revenue acquisition. With a few minutes 
left in the meeting, discussions surrounding recurring revenue ended 
up being rushed and not receiving the attention they deserved.
This happens all the time, and it underscores the claim that recurring 
revenue often remains overlooked within organizations that operate on 
the marketing and sales funnel, which models revenue acquisition. 
This raises the question: Is there a model for recurring revenue?

This change in the way how revenue is recognized rendered the classic 
marketing and sales funnel inadequate. Enter the Bowtie model, which extends 
the funnel 4 additional stages to capture growth from acquisition, retention, and 
expansion.
● Sub-System 4. Mutual Commit: "Closing a deal" is not the end; instead, it 
marks the beginning of a multi-year relationship. Both parties commit to 
working together: one to continue delivering the promised impact, and the 
other to keep paying for the product's usage to achieve that impact. 
Therefore, this stage is referred to as Mutual Commit or simply Commit.
● Sub-System 5. Onboarding: Onboarding, also known as Activation in PLG, is 
designed to swiftly guide customers to experience their initial impact with 
your product. Whether it takes weeks due to complex integrations or mere 
seconds through a browser plugin, the objective remains the same: to ensure 
customers swiftly experience the effect or impact of your product.
● Sub-System 6. Adoption: During Adoption, the customer integrates the 
product into their daily routines. Providers must offer training, support, and 
updates to optimize product usage and impact. Effective Adoption leads 
naturally to contract renewal.
● Sub-System 7. Expansion: This stage aims to grow your business with the 
customer. Expansion involves additional licenses, upgrading to higher-tier 
plans, or tapping into extra modules and features.
The acquisition system in the marketing and sales funnel, is now replaced by a 
new system that covers the entire operation:
● Sub-System 8. The GTM System: Encompasses all sub-systems that 
together make the recurring revenue model work. The GTM system 
possesses its own characteristics and can face challenges even when the 
individual sub-systems perform effectively. For instance, a batch of bad 
deals resulting in high churn. It is here where we need to address the issues 
raised by the grow-at-all-costs approach.

To understand the importance of the GTM System, consider this analogy: think 
of an orchestra. Each section—like percussion, brass, and strings—represents a 
sub-system. Each has its own role and music sheet, but the orchestra as a 
whole possesses unique characteristics. If one section falls out of sync, the 
overall performance suffers, regardless of each musician's skill level. Enter the 
conductor, who ensures the system works as a cohesive whole.
Similarly, even if every function across the entire customer journey works well, 
the overall system can suffer if these functions aren't orchestrated in harmony. 
This is especially true in a recurring revenue business. A minor shift in lead 
volume or a slight dip in retention can dramatically affect overall performance, 
much like small changes in rhythm or tempo can impact a band's performance.
Acknowledging the existence of the overarching GTM system that interconnects 
all of the sub-systems raises the question: who owns the GTM system? Today, 
the CEO is the only authority that can allocate budgets and resources across the 
company. However, there is no clear answer; our money is on a person with a 
background in ﬁnancial modeling, but clearly, this warrants further exploration in 
the years to come.

Customer centricity is more than just placing the customer at the 
forefront; it's fundamentally about ensuring they achieve the desired 
impact from your product. 
The Bowtie model illustrates this by viewing each stage from the 
customer's perspective. Awareness, for example, isn't just about 
recognizing your product's excellence or your company's reputation. It's 
about the customer realizing they have a problem that needs solving, 
marking the start of their solution-seeking journey.
Following the commitment stage, we encounter terms like “Adoption” and 
“Retention.” Adoption refers to the customer's initial use of a product, 
leading to Retention, where they consistently experience the product's 
beneﬁts. The terms Adoption (customer perspective) and Retention 
(seller perspective) will be used interchangeably throughout this book.
Consider an applicant tracking system provider for example. Customer 
centricity means focusing not just on getting customers to sign up and 
install the product but taking the responsibility to help them establish 
best practices using the product, resulting in hiring the right ﬁt.
Most SaaS companies still operate in the paradigm of offering a 
customer a turnkey solution. The term “turnkey” was popularized in the 
'80s and '90s by on-prem hardware vendors. In this context, customer 
centricity involves delivering a ready-to-use or “turn-the-key” solution, 
shifting the responsibility of extracting value and achieving results entirely 
onto the customer. The turnkey approach marked a signiﬁcant 
advancement from its predecessor, where sellers would provide the 
equipment, but buyers had to undertake the installation themselves, 
bearing all the responsibilities and associated risks.
To answer the question, customer centricity is about helping customers 
achieve the recurring impact they were promised each time they make a 
(recurring) payment.

CLOSED-LOOP SYSTEMS
One of the most common misunderstandings derived from running a business 
using the classic marketing and sales funnel is that it does not reveal the 
presence of closed loops. 
Yet, when you ask revenue leaders at any successful company where most 
of its growth comes from, you will hear things like word of mouth, existing 
customers expanding, and referrals from users who like the product. What 
all of these have in common is that they are the result of a “closed loop.”
The Difference Between an Open- and a Closed-Loop System
Closed-loop systems are embedded in our day-to-day lives; we engage with 
them more often than we think. This begs the question: what exactly is a 
closed-loop system? At its core, an open-loop system takes an input (leads), 
undergoes a process (the acquisition system), and produces an output (revenue) 
without ever pausing to assess the quality or accuracy of that output. In 
contrast, a closed-loop system uses a feedback loop to compare the output with 
the original input, enabling informed decisions.

Real-World Example: The Thermostat
Consider your home thermostat, a prime example of a closed-loop system. You 
set a desired temperature, and the thermostat works continuously to adjust the 
room's climate until it matches your setting.
Now, let's apply this same principle to assess leads. By leveraging AI to analyze 
calls from existing and satisﬁed customers, we can extract the impact they are 
experiencing. This insight enables organizations to reﬁne their lead generation 
strategies and allocate resources more effectively to campaigns that are likely to 
attract the right kind of customers—those who consistently generate recurring 
revenue. This is what we mean by "closing the loop."
Three Steps to Create a Closed-Loop System
The power of a recurring revenue system comes from a tightly knit structure, 
that is born to operate as a closed-loop system. It takes 3 simple steps to close 
the loop.
1. Expand the Funnel into a Bowtie: Create a complete view of the 
customer journey by extending the marketing and sales funnel to 
include recurring revenue, adding the "customer success" stages.
2. Use Impact to Connect the Sub-systems: Connect the sub-systems 
to work as a whole and synchronize them all using a common 
language and goal. This is referred to as the GTM approach. The 
GTM approach uses Customer Impact.
3. Close the Feedback (Recurring) Loop: Identify and develop the 
feedback loops within your business. We tackle this topic next.
The success of PLG in can be traced back to these steps. In PLG, customers play 
a crucial role in bringing in “leads” through word of mouth; customers are 
“closing the loop” by generating new leads one at a time. The organization stays 
informed about the impact customers derive from the product through metrics 
such as Monthly Active Users (MAU) and Weekly Active Users (WAU). This 
approach of customer advocacy and data-driven insights has been instrumental 
in PLG's success.

Identifying Closed Loops
The pinnacle of a subscription business is realized when it functions as a 
closed-loop system. In a closed-loop setting, the system evolves by learning 
from its actions and feeding outcomes such as customer feedback back into the 
system in real time.
For the longest time, people believed that a customer would only provide 
feedback and act as a referral once they were a happy customer, but this is not 
the case. In fact, a customer really does not want to be the only one among all 
their peers who picks your solution. This means that a customer can and will 
mention your name, and they will do this long before achieving the desired 
impact. This demonstrates the presence and power of closed loops.
Across the Bowtie, you'll ﬁnd numerous closed loops that either compound 
revenue growth or generate new leads and opportunities.

2. that could beneﬁt from your solution, thereby reducing their own risk. Savvy 
companies make this query part of the onboarding process.
3. Advocacy: Another common closed loop involves satisﬁed customers 
becoming advocates, either spontaneously on social media or through 
formal channels like a customer advisory board.
4. Ideal Customer Proﬁle: Updating your acquisition strategy based on your 
best customers can form a closed loop, which AI can eventually automate.
5. Referrals: Even during the sales process, customers often discuss your 
solution with peers, potentially pulling them away from competitors. For 
example, anybody who uses the PLG as a GTM motion knows that they 
need to encourage existing users to invite their peers to join.
6. Nurturing: Some customers, interested but not yet ready to buy, can 
become “talking leaﬂets” as they stay updated on your offerings. Various 
nurturing levels exist, from monthly newsletters to press releases and 
social media updates.
Closed loops are powerful as they are highly effective and eﬃcient ways of 
achieving growth. To make a closed loop work in your organization, however, you 
need to do something. 
The Key To Making Closed Loops Work 
The key to unlocking the full potential of closed loops lies in having a shared goal 
across all customer-facing roles. It calls for an integrated GTM approach that 
fosters collaboration and knowledge sharing. Contrast this with a siloed 
organization, where various functions operate in isolation, each pursuing its own 
objectives. As you'll discover in the Operating Model (Chapter 8), the unifying 
thread connecting all customer-facing roles is Impact.
It's crucial to understand that Revenue Architecture is about identifying 
and leveraging a company's closed loops. We will need to establish proven 
processes to harness these loops' potential, especially those involving human 
effort. And that brings us to the following topic: the importance of processes.

Historically, business to business GTM motions were primarily based on 
sales-led growth (SLG). Deals were forged through in-person meetings 
and many emails and phone calls facilitated by sales representatives. 
However, recent years have ushered in a paradigm shift: the advent of 
PLG. PLG is not just another marketing lead generation campaign or an 
innovative sales strategy, but rather a comprehensive approach that 
touches every aspect of customer interaction. Its deﬁning feature? A 
closed-loop system. 
PLG centers the product as the catalyst for growth. Through the nuanced 
use of customer product feedback and observing behavioral trends, it 
continuously reﬁnes both the product and its promotional strategies, 
setting into motion a relentless cycle of improvement.
The PLG framework establishes deep bonds between a company and its 
customers. These lasting relationships promote sustained growth within 
existing accounts, with continuous engagement bolstering them further. 
The ongoing interactions provide crucial insights that help blueprint new 
customer acquisition and improved engagement. The result? A system 
that stands resilient, and is in sync with evolving customer preferences. 
As we watch the business world evolve, a fresh concept emerges: 
customer-led growth (CLG). While PLG leverages standout product 
features to attract new prospects, and SLG depends on astute marketing 
and sales maneuvers, CLG distinctively taps into the might of customer 
communities to ignite new opportunities. Intriguingly, all 3 adopt a 
closed-loop system methodology.
In the 1990s, the early adopters of the internet were among the ﬁrst to 
succeed. In the 2000s, it was those who embraced software. In the 
2010s, the pioneers of cloud technology led the way. Now, in the 2020s, 
those who embrace AI are poised to be the big winners. 
Embracing AI involves adhering to systems and processes, particularly 
closed-loop systems. The success of PLG has demonstrated this.

PROCESSES EXPLAINED
A process is a series of proven actions taken in a speciﬁc order. A process 
aims to yield the same, or at least a similar, outcome each time it's correctly 
executed. This repeatability suggests that you can scale your business based 
on these processes; doing more will yield bigger results. Processes can 
subsequently be documented, optimized, and automated through technology 
to deliver an even bigger outcome.
Processes focus on the how—how an action is performed, how an outcome 
is achieved, and so on. The objective is to make the process simple enough 
for people to operate it. However, achieving simplicity is really hard, especially 
when the process must accommodate thousands of different individuals, 
across hundreds of companies, each doing it their own way. 
What we are trying to accomplish is akin to reading time on a watch: it 
appears straightforward on the surface, but the intricate workings beneath 
are quite complex. Similarly, a well-designed process provides simplicity for 
users while managing a series of complex operations underneath.
People-Centric vs. Process-Centric
Early-stage Startups are renowned for their high concentration of superstars, 
which typically includes the founder and extends to the ﬁrst group of people 
such as engineers, product management, marketers, ﬁrst sellers, etc. In its 
formative stages, the company heavily relies on the intuitive judgment of 
these standout performers. Their depth of expertise, culled from years or 
even decades in their respective ﬁelds, makes these superstars instrumental 
in propelling the company (and its products) to its ﬁrst few million dollars in 
recurring revenue. In the early days, they excel in an environment without 
well-deﬁned processes, allowing for swift actions and decisions. Given the 
team’s size at this stage, processes are nebulous, the infrastructure is 
rudimentary, and data are often discarded.

As a superstar (people-centric) organization grows, it destabilizes as more and more 
tasks stack on top of each other without any structural framework. Note that this can 
apply to a GTM motion, function, or entire company.
FIGURE 4.6
As the organization scales, actions start to pile up haphazardly. At ﬁrst this is not 
a problem, but soon enough, often in the second or third year, the lack of 
well-deﬁned processes begins to destabilize the organization's structure.
When a startup secures additional funding, it often expands its workforce by 
ﬁve- to tenfold within a year, all while operating in an environment without 
established processes. Soon, people will leave, and key departures exacerbate 
the issue, often necessitating a reset. 
The rapid growth combined with the absence of robust processes intensify 
organizational instability and chaos at the worst time. Venture-backed ﬁrms, 
expected to grow quickly and facing high turnover, experience this instability 
acutely. Without clear processes in place, new hires contribute to the chaos as 
they introduce their own methods and approaches to the job.

The transition from people-centric to process-centric is a major Phase shift, and 
as we established in Section 1.4, this transition is enormous, it require at least 12 
(if not 24) months to make the change, and there is no clarion call alerting the 
management team to start the transition from a people-centric to a 
process-centric approach. 
Regrettably, the primary catalyst for such a shift often emerges when escalating 
chaos impedes growth… which is guaranteed to happen. This frequently leads to 
a moment when the board steps in to make signiﬁcant alterations to the 
management team, starting with the revenue leader.
This phase shift does not just happen once. This also occurs with the launch of 
a new product, or a new GTM motion. In fact, it can happen breaking ground in a 
new region, or entering a new vertical market, etc.
A people-centric culture without structured processes eventually becomes its downfall 
due to scalability issues. The challenge is the shift from a non-scalable, people-centric 
approach to a scalable, process-centric one. Complicating this transition is the absence 
of a deﬁning moment signaling the need for change.

The Phase Shift From People-Centric to Process-Centric
What is the difference between process-centric and people-centric cultures. 
What sets them apart? The difference becomes glaringly apparent when 
things start going awry. In a people-centric culture, the immediate reaction is 
to blame and ﬁre the individuals involved rather than examining the ﬂawed 
processes. In essence, people operating within the system become 
scapegoats, and leaders assume that bringing in new talent will magically 
resolve the issue.
This hire-and-ﬁre strategy often worsens the problem, as systems and 
processes require stability to function effectively. Again, it's worth noting 
that the average tenure of individuals in a GTM role at a hypergrowth 
organization hovers around 24 months. You might be scratching your head, 
grappling with these compounding complexities. But remember, to achieve 
extraordinary results, you're tasked with solving extraordinary problems.
What We Can Learn From Human Error Studies
The core philosophy in a process-centric organization is to identify 
errors as outcomes inﬂuenced by several factors: lack of process, poor 
execution of existing processes, or application of incorrect processes—
and often, a mix of these. For example: think of salespeople using the 
wrong acquisition process to renew deals or CSMs failing to upsell 
effectively due to a skills gap.
What Caused It, Not Who Did It.
In the year 2000, Professor James Reason, an emeritus professor of 
psychology at the University of Manchester, published a seminal paper titled 
“Human Error: Models and Management.” His central thesis suggests that 
humans are inherently fallible, making errors inevitable even in the most 
eﬃcient organizations. Professor Reason argues that errors should be 
viewed as consequences rather than root causes, originating from upstream 
systemic factors, which often involve the use of ﬂawed processes or the 
absence of processes altogether.

## Page 108

The countermeasures employed are grounded in the idea that while we can't 
alter human nature, we can use people and technology to reﬁne processes. 
This could mean revamping the recruiting or onboarding process, among other 
things. So, when something goes south—like missing a revenue target—the key 
question is not "who's at fault?" but rather "what caused this?"
Timing the Shift
Venture-backed companies should begin the transition from people-centric to 
process-centric when they hit as early as $10M in ARR, or for larger 
organizations $10M, per speciﬁc GTM motion. If your company has only one 
product, consider the C-funding round as the signal to initiate this shift.
Who is responsible for doing this? The onus falls squarely on the 
CEO's shoulders to initiate the monumental shift from a people-centric 
to a process-centric organization. The CEO isn't just the ﬁgurehead but 
the strategic decision-maker who must ensure that this project not 
only kicks off on time but also reaches completion within a 2-year 
timeframe.
Why the CEO? Well, they are the only authority within the organization 
capable of overseeing the big picture and deciding the allocation of 
ﬁnancial resources across various departments. This funding could 
involve hiring new team members, investing in new software tools, or 
even pivoting the company’s strategy.
Furthermore, the CEO has the option to assemble a dedicated team, 
referred to as the "GTM Oﬃce." This specialized team would work in 
tandem with the CEO to ensure the systematic implementation of new 
processes, track milestones, and make necessary adjustments as the 
project progresses.

The Role of Improvement Processes
The GTM approach, which includes various functions across marketing, 
sales, and customer success teams, often suffers from a lack of focus on 
process improvement. To illustrate, we conducted a study in early 2023 with 
one of our largest customers. Over a 6-month period, we analyzed 50,000 
sales opportunities involving thousands of sellers. The results showed that 
those who followed a proven process outperformed those who didn't by 
1.53x when handling the same type and amount of opportunities.
At most companies, an executive team would swiftly approve the 
development of a new feature or the launch of a marketing campaign that 
would boost revenue by 1.53x. Similarly, any sales leader would hire a seller 
capable of outperforming sellers at that rate. Any CEO would endorse the 
purchase of a tool that delivers such an increase in revenue. However, in a 
Scaleup there’s a surprising hesitancy to invest in process improvements that 
could achieve a 1.53x increase in revenue using existing resources.
This is awkward, because over the past few decades, many industries have 
successfully prioritized processes to enhance eﬃciency, reduce costs, and 
improve customer satisfaction—all objectives that align perfectly with the 
goals of building a recurring revenue factory. The absence of this 
process-centric mindset is so prevalent that it won't resolve itself—active 
intervention is required from the executive team, particularly the CEO, as this 
kind of shift often involves allocating budgets across various departments.
The Payoff: Become the Category Leader
There is a fantastic payoff though. Companies that are proactive and excel in 
using processes emerge as dominant category leaders. A few examples 
include:
● 86% of all engineering departments use Agile for Software development.
● Ford and Toyota adopted Total Quality Management (TQM) across the 
entire company. 
4.3.3

● Motorola and GE use Six Sigma to streamline manufacturing.
● More recently, Airbnb, Netﬂix, and UberEats all employed Design Thinking.
Historically, as organizations reach a certain size, they must implement 
processes to continue scaling. Scaleups are no different. Venture-backed 
organizations must recognize their status as revenue factories and realize 
that the absence of a GTM process is the Achilles heel in their growth journey. 
They must adopt a process-centric approach when they hit $10M in ARR.
Scaling and the Long Road to IPO
As the organization grows, it becomes increasingly unstable if you are not using 
processes, which means that you will need a lot of consultants to shore up the 
organization, as depicted in Figure 4.6. 
Many companies we've worked with are gearing up for a form of an equity event 
such as an IPO. Going public doesn't happen overnight—it takes years. During 
this period, there will be several generations of executives, each introducing new 
tools, methodologies, etc., all of which not only yield suboptimal growth but also 
inﬂate costs unnecessarily.
The First Mover Advantage
If this resonates with you, you're not alone. Viewed from a different perspective, 
this common struggle provides a golden opportunity to distinguish yourself. 
Remember, the key to the success of powerhouse organizations like Netﬂix or 
the Navy Seals is their commitment to robust processes. 
Today, businesses with recurring revenue operate much like factories, 
aiming for growth in volume, cost eﬃciency, and product quality—goals that 
mirror traditional factories' objectives. As competition heats up, it's only logical 
to expect that any recurring revenue business will eventually need a quality 
management process. There is too much at stake, and if the business to 
consumer (B2C) market is any indicator, it's that ﬁrst movers of scale 
became market leaders. Big or small, we hope these insights serve as a step 
toward achieving a similar goal for your company.

Quality management originated in manufacturing and left a signiﬁcant 
mark on the Industrial Revolution. It introduced the concept of 
standardization, facilitating increased production of goods with 
consistent quality. This standardization played a vital role in ensuring 
customer satisfaction and fostering repeat business, making it a 
fundamental aspect of the Industrial Revolution's success.
Various factors and events in the business world underscored the 
importance of quality management. In the mid-1980s, Motorola, a 
prominent electronic device manufacturer, confronted ﬁerce competition 
from Japanese companies renowned for their highly eﬃcient 
manufacturing processes. Recognizing this competitive threat, Motorola 
understood the urgent need to enhance product quality and reduce 
defects. In response, they introduced the Six Sigma methodology, a 
data-driven approach consisting of 5 phases: deﬁne, measure, analyze, 
improve, and control. This initiative proved highly effective in reducing 
defects and variability in both manufacturing and business operations.
Motorola's success with Six Sigma did not go unnoticed. By the 1990s, 
quality management had gained widespread acceptance within the 
manufacturing sector. Today, a diverse range of industries, from 
healthcare and ﬁnance to technology, embraces quality management 
solutions to increase production, lower costs, improve quality, and 
enhance customer satisfaction.
The need for quality management did not emerge from a single event 
but evolved due to competitive pressures confronting global businesses 
and the ongoing pursuit of process enhancement and product 
competitiveness. In the contemporary industrial landscape, quality 
management continues to play a pivotal role by promoting 
standardization to boost productivity, enhance eﬃciency, and foster 
customer satisfaction.

into a Bowtie, interconnect all the functions, and then close the loop. 
There are numerous types of closed loops, such as: (1) Renewals, where 
customers renew or expand their business; (2) Risk sharing, when a customer 
refers you to another team to mitigate the risk; (3) Advocacy, when satisﬁed 
customers share their positive experiences on social media; (4) Learning from 
existing customers about your ICP; (5) Referrals, as users invite their peers to 
join; and (6) Spreading the word to raise the awareness about your offerings.

A people-centric culture without structured processes eventually becomes its downfall 
due to scalability issues. The challenge is the shift from a non-scalable people-centric

Given the high volume of active customers inherent to recurring revenue models, 
businesses need to transition from a people-centric approach, which relies on 
hiring superstars, to a process-centric approach that systematically pursues 
iterative improvements to maintain customer satisfaction and growth.
GTM teams aren't the ﬁrst to face the challenge to shift from a people-centric 
operation to a process-centric operation. Many other industries have 
experienced similar issues and have successfully addressed them through 
approaches such as Six Sigma, Design Thinking, Lean Manufacturing, Total 
Quality Management, and Agile Software Development. By applying the best 
practices of these methodologies, GTM teams can overcome the quality 
(impact) obstacles and ensure the consistent delivery of desired customer 
outcomes.

Where does growth originate from?
Most organizations are fundamentally built on an outdated First Principle, in that 
their systems and processes are modeled after perpetual software businesses, 
where growth stems mainly from customer acquisition. 
Growth in a recurring revenue business comprises of 3 components:
● Acquisition: Initially new customer fuel growth.
● Retention: Over time, a pivotal shift occurs from acquisition to retention. 
Keeping customers becomes vital, with renewals forming the cornerstone of 
exponential growth.
● Expansion: Eventually, growth from existing customers who derive 
increasing value from your product, will outpace growth from acquisition.
This transformation toward a customer-centric model is based on the principle 
that recurring revenue stems from consistently delivering recurring impact.
In the aftermath of the 2022 crash, an urgent need for a more sustainable 
approach developed. This approach must extend beyond mere cost reduction 
and free cash ﬂow generation. For a recurring revenue business, the strategic 
focus must revolve around the primary objective of delivering recurring impact. 
Neglecting this imperative will lead many companies astray in the years ahead.
Can we design growth machines?
To consistently deliver recurring impact, organizations must shift away from the 
traditional Marketing and Sales funnel, which offers only a limited perspective of 
the system, primarily emphasizing growth through customer acquisition.

Instead, adopting a model based on the Bowtie that encompasses the key 
growth components—acquisition, retention, and expansion—is essential. In 
contrast, recurring revenue businesses see growth extending beyond the funnel. 
This shift challenges the conventional view and necessitates a move from an 
open-loop system, dependent on constant inputs (leads), to a closed-loop 
system, where existing customers actively contribute to growth.
How do we build growth machines?
To address this transformation effectively, a structured approach is essential. 
Proven models and data-driven decision-making play a crucial role in navigating 
the complexities of a growth-oriented recurring revenue business. These models 
are designed in layers, with 3 foundational static models forming the base and 3 
adaptable dynamic models at the top. They work in harmony, powering the 
Recurring Revenue Factory.
Additionally, adopting a process-centric strategy for incremental improvements 
becomes vital. Instead of relying solely on superstar hires, organizations should 
focus on processes, using iterative improvements to ensure customer 
satisfaction, which, in turn, leads to sustainable growth.
Furthermore, data must serve a dual role—not only for measuring performance 
metrics like growth rate, costs, and proﬁts but also as a crucial tool for 
designing, building, and optimizing systems. It's essential to note that deploying 
technology with the goal of delivering not just more but also better results is key 
to achieving recurring impact.
The forthcoming chapters will introduce a series of models designed to create, 
build, and deploy recurring revenue factories. These models are rooted in the 
fundamental principle that recurring revenue is the direct outcome of recurring 
impact. This approach aligns means and methods, incorporating technology and 
methodologies, to signiﬁcantly enhance our current success rate.

As we have learned in the previous chapters, recurring revenue growth stems 
from delivering impactful results. We can utilize models to design a 'revenue 
factory' aimed at achieving its primary goal: delivering a high-quality product that 
promotes cost-eﬃcient growth, with customers playing a pivotal role. To 
accomplish this, we will begin with 3 foundational models of a recurring revenue 
system:
● The Revenue Model builds on the insights we have gathered in First 
Principles; it deﬁnes the why and how of your revenue streams, offering 
unique operational metrics and risk proﬁles for each strategy.
● The Data Model is based on the ﬁndings of systems and processes 
and has become a Bowtie showing us the full customer lifecycle—
from acquisition to long-term engagement.
● The Mathematical Model acts as the engineering blueprint, offering 
mathematical insights into how your revenue behaves under various 
conditions. It goes beyond traditional linear assumptions, uncovering 
the sophisticated nature of a recurring revenue engine. 
While you may not see these models in the day-to-day grind, make no 
mistake: they are the backbone of any scalable, eﬃcient, and sustainable 
recurring revenue business. Just like our skyscraper, understanding these 
foundations not only ensures that we stand tall but also helps us navigate the 
complexities and subtleties of exponential growth and customer engagement.

In the picture above, you can see how the models are layered. In this structure, 
the most fundamental layers refer to the lower layers of the model, speciﬁcally 
the Revenue Model, the Data Model, and the Mathematical Model. These models 
are fundamental because they provide the essential infrastructure necessary for 
revenue generation. They model how revenue is generated, measure growth, and 
provide a mathematical basis for growth. It is best to set up these models 
thoroughly and not tinker too much, with them as they will impact all layers on 
top. 
As we will learn, these foundational models will tell us that a recurring revenue 
machine operates quite differently compared to traditional models of growth, 
which we have been using during the golden era. 
Once we have designed the revenue factory in Part II, adhering to the 
fundamentals discussed in Part I, we can then construct a revenue factory 
according to the models that form the upper layers: the Operating Model, the 
Growth Model, and the GTM Model.
The static models form the base of the recurring revenue system. They require minimal 
to no adjustments once properly designed. They are indispensable for the system's 
stability, eﬃciency, and long-term growth.

In the 2017 movie "The Founder," Ray Kroc, a struggling milkshake machine 
salesman portrayed by Michael Keaton, stumbles upon a small but highly 
eﬃcient burger restaurant called McDonald's. Fascinated by their innovative 
"Speedee Service System" and its growth potential, Kroc persuades the 
McDonald brothers, Dick and Mac, to expand their business nationally. 
Initially, the McDonald brothers employed a straightforward monetization 
strategy centered around offering quality burgers at an affordable price. 
However, Kroc sees the untapped opportunity for immense proﬁtability 
by redeﬁning their approach to monetization. He introduces the concept of 
franchising, allowing individuals to become owners and operators of their 
McDonald's restaurants while paying royalties to the company. 
This strategic shift in monetization strategy in which the royalties become the 
main recurring revenue stream, leads to remarkable growth and expansion, 
transforming McDonald's from a modest local eatery to a global fast-food 
empire with over 40,000 outlets. The story shows how a well-executed change in 
monetization strategy can be instrumental in driving business success and 
reshaping entire industries. 
In recent years, the B2B market has witnessed a similarly transformative shift. in 
monetization strategy; we are talking about transitioning from traditional 
on-premises hardware and perpetual software that got paid up front to 
cloud-based software that today uses a subscription or a consumption model.

The subscription-based monetization strategy has given rise to more than 
30,000 SaaS companies in the past decade. These SaaS companies rely on 
this subscription model as their primary monetization strategy. This shift has 
profoundly impacted the market, disrupting traditional business models and 
unlocking new opportunities for scalability and customer-centricity. To better 
understand the signiﬁcance of this shift, we will delve into the Revenue Model, 
which will provide insights into the dynamics at play.
The revenue model encompasses 3 closely related terms:
● Monetization Strategy: Refers to how a seller monetizes its product, 
particularly regarding the transfer of ownership or offering different 
usage terms. Common monetization strategies include Ownership (pay 
to own), Subscription (pay to use), and Consumption (pay per use).
● Pricing and Packaging: Pricing sets the cost customers pay for a 
product or service, while packaging determines how these offerings are 
bundled or presented. For instance, based on a subscription offer, tiering 
a product in 3 tiers is a method of pricing and packaging.
● Business Model: A combination of the monetization strategy and the 
pricing and packaging strategy, tailored for a targeted market, including 
a way to reach and serve the market known as the Go-To-Market model.
This deﬁnes how a business earns income, shapes its offerings to meet 
market demands, and positions itself in the competitive landscape. 
For example, consider a startup that develops a new product targeting a 
speciﬁc user group. It chooses a cloud-based model and a subscription 
monetization strategy with an annual contract. This approach not only 
reduces development costs but also boosts valuation due to the recurring 
revenue model, though it sets expectations for rapid growth. The SaaS 
startup then creates 3 tiered packages, each priced according to different 
features and beneﬁts. Customers have the option to choose between 
monthly or annual billing, with both requiring upfront payment.

THE REVENUE MODEL EXPLAINED 
The revenue model encompasses a company's pricing and packaging strategy. 
Today, pricing is multifaceted, extending beyond simply setting a cost. It includes 
selecting the right pricing model, such as consumption-based vs. subscription 
pricing. Packaging also has evolved with the creation of tiered service levels to 
address diverse customer needs, thereby allowing a more customized approach 
that better ﬁt the customer’s needs. There are many different monetization 
strategies, we focus on three:
● Ownership: This strategy involves customers purchasing and owning 
products outright. Examples include goods like cars, furniture, or electronics. 
Here, customers make an upfront payment to acquire ownership.
● Subscription: Customers pay a recurring fee to access a product or service 
over an agreed period. This model is prevalent in streaming services, SaaS, 
and membership programs, offering continuous access as long as the 
subscription is maintained.
● Consumption: This strategy involves billing customers based on their actual 
usage of a product or service. Common in utilities like electricity or water, 
customers are charged according to their consumption levels.
Each of these monetization strategies has unique characteristics that carries 
distinct implications for revenue growth, resource allocation, cost structure, and 
business valuation. The Revenue Model helps us understand these differences 
and the impact is has on a business.
Through this model, we explore how these strategies inﬂuence business 
operations and the GTM strategy. What you will learn is that many SaaS 
organizations still operate within the framework of the traditional B2B 
perpetual software model despite the shift in monetization strategies that 
have taken place. The Revenue Model helps us comprehend the unique 
strengths of each speciﬁc monetization strategy. It illustrates how businesses 
operate along an arc, representing a spectrum of monetization strategies.

The 3 monetization strategies occupy positions along this arc. Changing the 
monetization strategy results in a business moving along the arc, resulting in a 
redistribution of responsibilities between the buyer and the seller.
To illustrate this, please refer to Table 5.1. Observe how the fundamental tasks' 
responsibilities shift from the buyer to the seller as we transition from one 
monetization model to another. For example, in the Subscription Model, it is the 
seller’s responsibility to develop the product and support its implementation. 
Meanwhile, the buyer, often the end-user, is responsible for correctly installing 
and utilizing the product.

Different Types of Ownership
In the ownership model, the buyer pays up front for the product and is 
responsible for extracting value from the exchange by installing, using, and 
maintaining the product. For example, when you buy a car, the buyer instantly 
becomes the owner but must still drive the vehicle and cover expenses such 
as gasoline, road tax, parking, etc. Similarly, when buying on-premise hardware 
like a server, the buyer is responsible for the installation, use, and maintenance. 
After the purchase has shipped, the seller carries little responsibility besides 
addressing any defects during manufacturing, often covered under a limited 
manufacturer’s warranty. The buyer has to do all the work.

OWNERSHIP
A perpetual software license is an agreement that grants the buyer the right to 
use a speciﬁc version of a software product for an indeﬁnite period via a one- 
time upfront payment. This type of purchase is tied to a particular software 
version, and obtaining newer versions requires a new purchase. Perpetual 
licenses offer users the advantage of long-term access to a stable software 
version without recurring subscription costs, making them a preferred choice for 
those who value ownership and control.

Types of Subscription
In the subscription model, the buyer pays a recurring fee for using the product 
or service for the contracted period, but the buyer never becomes the owner.
The most popular subscription model in B2B is SaaS. They can encompass a 
broader range of products or services beyond software applications. The most 
common subscription types are: Monthly and Annually, and Multiple (2) Year.
As the payment window extends from annual to biennial, to triennial, and 
beyond, you gradually move towards an ownership model, which historically 
operates on a 5- to 7-year amortization schedule. Conversely, as the payment 
window shortens from pay-per-month to weekly, daily, hourly, and eventually to 
pay-per-second, you eventually arrive at consumption-based payments.
As a subscriber, you pay for using the product over a period of time.FIGURE 5.3

Much like McDonald's, Netﬂix built an empire through a change in the revenue 
model. Historically video rental business was a usage model. Today as a Netﬂix 
customer, you pay a monthly fee to access their library. In this case it is the seller 
who pays for all the costs involved to give a customer the ability to enjoy their 
content. It is Netﬂix who has to pay for the infrastructure that makes this 
possible. This model is cost eﬃcient when it applies to an

Infrastructure that can be used by all users. For Netﬂix, all users access the 
same content library. If a single customer requests a custom-made piece of 
content, Netﬂix would need to shift to an ownership model of monetization, 
requiring the customer to cover production costs and proﬁt up front. Producing a 
TV series can cost tens to hundreds of millions of dollars for just a few 
episodes. In the consumer world, monthly subscription contracts such as those 
for TV services are popular, allowing users to unsubscribe whenever they want.
Today, business is moving in all directions, such as from monthly to annual 
contracts, and more recently even to multi-year contracts. A multi-year contract 
requires contemplation as it foregoes part of the compound growth mechanics. 
But it makes sense when an organization such as a government requires the 
buyer to spend all of the budget in a single year. Another area where multi-year 
contracts make sense is when the product sold requires a deep investment up 
front from both parties, for instance, in onboarding and training.
Types of Consumption
In the consumption model, you pay for usage, e.g., by unit of use. The more you 
use, the more you pay. An early example was putting a quarter in a payphone to 
make a call. Telcos paid for the manufacturing of the phone booths, their 
installation throughout the country, the network, and maintenance to keep the 
network operational. All the user had to do was put in a quarter to make a call. In 
a recurring revenue business, that same consumption model can manifest in a 
few different ways. One example is for the use of processing power with an AI 
service, or the amount of storage or bandwidth consumed. 
A further variation is a pay-per-action, commonly used in the ad industry, when 
the a provider gets paid based on a click, such as an online ad. The trend over the 
past years has shifted even further to the right, in which a seller of ads no longer 
gets paid when the consumer clicks on the ad but only when the seller achieves 
the intended outcome. A great example is sports betting in which the provider 
gets paid only when a consumer has deposited the money.

Pay per use
Pay-per-click (PPC) is a prevalent consumption-based monetization strategy in 
online advertising in which, advertisers pay a fee each time an ad is clicked. The 
cost per click (CPC) varies based on several factors and can range from just a 
few cents to tens of dollars. The variation is inﬂuenced by the competitiveness of 
keywords, the target market, and the platform used for advertising.
CHARACTERISTICS OF THE REVENUE MODEL
The various monetization strategies within the revenue model cause the 
business to operate differently. Key changes include:
● A radical change from selling value to delivering impact.
● A shift of risk from the buyer to the seller.
● A drop in price by an order of magnitude for each new GTM model.
● A decline in win rate causing the demand for an increase in leads.
● A change in velocity, one of the key drivers of hypergrowth.
● A decrease in retention, increasing the need for more customers/users.
These are just a few characteristics among many, but understanding them can 
provide insight into how the revenue model functions and the effect it has on the 
other models.
In the consumption model you can pay per use, for an action, or for a speciﬁc outcome.FIGURE 5.4

From Selling Value to Delivering Impact
Within the Revenue Model, the seller's objectives differ based on whether the 
buyer pays up front or opts for a subscription or consumption-based payment. 
To clarify these differences, let's categorize the concepts of Value and Impact:
● Value: This term refers to the perceived beneﬁts or value that customers 
expect from purchasing a product. Companies typically present a value 
proposition, promising speciﬁc results or beneﬁts. For instance, a company 
selling cloud-based project management software might promise enhanced 
eﬃciency, streamlined communication, and improved project tracking. 
Value represents a promise of future Impact.
● Impact: Impact signiﬁes the fulﬁllment of that promise, pertaining to the 
tangible, measurable results or beneﬁts that the product delivers during 
actual use. Using the previous example, if a small business purchases this 
software and subsequently experiences a 30% reduction in project 
completion time, better team collaboration, and fewer missed deadlines, 
these are measurable impacts of the product. 
Impact is the fulﬁllment of the promised Value. 
With this categorization, Value and Impact can be aligned with different aspects 
of the revenue model. Value corresponds to an ownership monetization strategy, 
where sellers promise value, but it's up to the customers to realize the impact 
from the product they purchased. 
In contrast, Impact is associated with the consumption model, where customers 
pay based on usage or even for the impact itself. With that said, a subscription 
business aligns with the Impact aspect as well, where ongoing customer 
payments are made only if the customer achieves impact over and over again. 
Therefore, both subscription and consumption- based monetization strategies 
hinge on the delivery of continuous, measurable impact.
133
5.2.1

## Page 134

C H A P T E R   0 5   |   R E V E N U E   M O D E L
For instance, SaaS services regularly enhance their software to ensure sustained 
beneﬁts for users. Furthermore, SaaS platforms often provide robust analytics, 
enabling customers to measure the software's impact on their business. This 
commitment to delivering continuous, measurable outcomes aligns with the 
First Principle of recurring revenue, which prioritizes delivering Impact rather 
than merely promising Value. This approach is a hallmark of subscription or 
consumption-based models.
OWNERSHIP
Risk of the Purchase
In an ownership model, the seller sells the promise of what the product can 
do, also known as "value." The buyer pays up front for the value the product 
offers on paper. With the purchase and the upfront payment, the buyer shoulders 
the risk of realizing the promised value. In an ownership model, the seller gets 
paid in advance and typically incurs minimal risks beyond potential 
inventory-related costs. If the purchase involves a large-scale order, the buyer 
must often make an upfront commitment in the form of a large payment, 
reducing the seller's risk to near zero. 
5.2.2
The chasm between different monetization strategies is substantial, underscoring the 
importance of careful consideration when applying best practices from 
ownership-based models to subscription and consumption models.

This contrasts the subscription model, in which the seller undertakes signiﬁcant 
commitments such as product development, licensing third-party software 
modules (often tied to a volume-based pricing structure), and hosting the service 
on a cloud platform, typically involving some volume commitment to the cloud 
service provider. Meanwhile, the customers of a subscription service don't care 
about the acquisition or retention costs or any other factors. They only care 
whether the product can and will deliver the "Impact" they need. 
Impact, which was promised as the value during the sales pitch. That tells us 
that impact is the realization of the value, value that was promised during the 
marketing and sales process. If the buyer does not experience impact 
repeatedly, they will cancel the subscription, which can happen long before the 
seller makes any proﬁt. The lack of proﬁt can quickly lead to a challenging 
situation, as the more deals a provider closes, the more money they lose.
This can be a problem when sales compensations are based solely on deals 
won. The salesperson doesn’t have to worry about retention because it’s not part 
of their compensation plan, so the company is taking on the risk while 
incentivising their reps to bring in as many deals as possible.
With a move to the cloud and the use of software, overall risk has decreased for 
both parties. On one hand, it is much easier for customers to sign up for a 
solution because there is less on the line. On the other hand, it is just as easy for 
them to quit, and customers will leave unless you deliver business impact 
repeatedly.
If you have been in business for over 10 years, you have experienced this shift 
in risk: selling to the Enterprise based on an ownership model takes 12 to 24 
months and likely another 6 to 12 months to roll it out. But with a SaaS offering, 
the customer can sample the impact through a smaller pilot before expanding 
the use of the product to other parts of the organization, which could take 
upwards of 3 to 6 months to acquire and roll out. This causes a revenue 
acceleration which is a clear outcome of moving to a subscription based model, 
a topic we will discuss later on in this chapter.

Buyer Seller
Price
As we move from left to right along the Revenue Model, we also see the price 
of the value exchange decrease. A perpetual software deal (ownership) can be 
measured in millions of dollars, paid up front, and is 10 times the size of a 
subscription deal (SaaS). A usage deal (consumption) goes even further and can 
be a fraction of the price of an annual SaaS contract. To the right, we run into 
multi-year SaaS contracts involving higher customer commitment. Multi-year 
agreements increase retention by making it more diﬃcult for customers to 
switch to other services during the contract term, for example,

due to the need for extensive onboarding and training up front, or because the 
buyer invested a lot of effort in extensive testing and vetting of a platform. 
However, multi-year contracts also present some unique risks and challenges. It 
limits a SaaS business's ability to increase the price over time, vital to growth in a 
recurring revenue business. Therefore, sellers should carefully consider the risks 
and beneﬁts of multi-year contracts and evaluate their customer retention 
strategies accordingly. To the far right of the spectrum, we eventually end up at 
the freemium model.

The freemium model stands out as it does not involve a direct value exchange 
where the buyer pays the seller. In this model, the seller offers value—typically 
access to a basic version of a product or service—without requiring monetary 
compensation from the buyer. Instead, the value exchange shifts to alternative 
methods. One common approach is for the seller to monitor the buyer's usage 
patterns. This data can be invaluable, often leveraged for targeted advertising, 
enhancing product features, or understanding customer behavior. The freemium 
model, therefore, relies on indirect methods of monetization, providing free 
services to a large user base while exploring other avenues for revenue 
generation.

Win Rate 
To make a million-dollar purchase, a buyer at a public company cannot simply 
submit a request for a quote with a group of vendors. The internal process of a 
large corporation requires the buyer ﬁrst to secure a budget, which means that 
by the time the buyer meets the seller, they are much more educated. The buyer 
understands the pain they are experiencing and is more committed to genuinely 
ﬁnding a way to solve it. 
Across industries, regions, and segments, the win rate in selling to large 
corporations using an ownership-based model is pretty much the same, around 
1:3. As we traverse the arc of the Revenue Model, the win rate starts to drop. The 
win rate for a SaaS solution based on an annual contract is more like 1:5, and 
based on a monthly contract, it deteriorates to 1:6 or even 1:7.

Intriguingly, as the buyer's risk decreases, the win rate paradoxically worsens. 
One might assume that reduced risk for the buyer should correlate with an 
improved win rate. The dynamics of the freemium model, often employed as a 
market entry strategy, provides insight into this paradox.

The free to paid conversion rate historically has been low, as low as one in a 
hundred. There are exceptions like services such as Spotify and Slack, which 
boast conversion rates as high as 1:5. Why is the free to paid conversion rate so 
low? With lower buyer risk, a surge of “unqualiﬁed” opportunities often ﬂood the 
sales funnel. This inﬂux of non-ideal prospects leads to a sharp decline in win 
rates.
In practice, we see the revenue model operating as a cohesive system in which 
different factors impact each other. Moving from an ownership to a 
consumption monetization model results in a substantial decrease in the 
average price per deal. Consequently, a larger volume of deals is needed to 
achieve similar ﬁnancial objectives. However, this shift also brings a notable 
drop in win rates, implying that relying solely on inbound leads for a 
volume-based approach is unsustainable and likely detrimental.
The key to addressing this challenge is to incentivize existing customers to refer 
new prospects. Success in this approach hinges on customer satisfaction with 
the product's impact. This underscores the importance of adapting business 
operations to suit the speciﬁc characteristics of the chosen monetization 
strategy. It highlights that strategies effective in an ownership model do not 
translate well to a subscription model.
Revenue Velocity
Revenue acceleration involves strategies and tactics that speed up a company's 
revenue generation, resulting in quicker growth. It stems from either shortening 
the revenue acquisition process or speeding up revenue expansion.
For acquisition, it depends on how quickly a lead can be converted into an 
opportunity, and then converting that opportunity into a mutual commitment— 
known as the sales cycle. In terms of expansion, revenue acceleration relies on 
customers buying more or renewing quicker, both of which depend on the 
product’s impact. Hence, accelerating revenue expansion is the result of a 
customer achieving the desired impact quicker.

Time for a lead to 
convert into an

Whereas revenue acquisition is based on consecutive acceleration, revenue 
expansion is based on 3 actions happening concurrently:
● The time it takes to adopt the service successfully. Are customers getting 
what they paid for? A successful outcome should take weeks to months 
depending on the complexity of the product in platform sales, and mere 
seconds in application sales, something we will come to learn to be PLG.
● The time it takes to achieve account penetration based on expansion. 
Think of increasing usage, reaching maximum users, and selling other 
products. This kind of growth can take months to years. Penetration of an 
account by sellers can start before the buyer achieves adoption. 
● The time it takes for a customer's business to grow. Account growth often 
takes years and is hard to accelerate artiﬁcially. Usually, there are a few 
accounts with lots of growth and many with a little bit of growth balanced by 
the contraction of a few customers (going out of business).
Suppose we double-click on revenue acceleration of the time it takes to convert 
an opportunity into a commitment (sales cycle). In that case, it tends 
Revenue acceleration for acquisition is based on consecutive acceleration and for 
retention and expansion it is based on concurrent acceleration.

The impact of the monetization strategy on revenue velocity.FIGURE 5.10
A common mistake is to consider revenue expansion consecutive. In other 
words, the account team waits to increase the contract size until the customer is 
"happy" or until all seats are used. Expansion is a concurrent task, so why not 
recommend expanding earlier? As a seller, you have more insight into usage 
patterns and can predict the buyer's growth needs. The buyer in many cases 
depends on the seller to make a recommendation.
Revenue Retention
When we look at retention, we will notice that the shorter the sales cycle, the 
lower the retention is, and the longer the sales cycle, the longer the retention is. 
For example, freemium customers retain at a much lower rate, whereas annual 
multi-year contracted customers retain at the highest rate.

In recurring revenue, retention (or churn) is a critical metric because it directly 
impacts revenue growth and proﬁtability, a metric referred to as net revenue 
retention (NRR), which we will discuss in detail throughout this book.
A business's average monthly retention rate based on recurring revenue depends 
on the industry, the speciﬁc product, and the customer base. However, as a 
general rule, a healthy monthly retention rate is above 98%. Annualized, this 
would mean a 78% annual retention. Compare this to an over 90% annual 
retention rate for an annual contract. It tells us monthly contract retention rates 
are much lower than annual contracts.

There are several reasons for this:
1. Flexibility: Monthly contracts offer customers more ﬂexibility than annual 
contracts, allowing customers to cancel or switch to another service easily.
2. Commitment: Annual contracts require customers to commit more to the 
service, increasing the cost and effort needed to switch to another service. 
Customers who make this commitment will do so carefully and therefore be 
more locked in when they do.

C H A P T E R   0 5   |   R E V E N U E   M O D E L
3. Price: Monthly contracts often cost 10% to 50% more than annual contracts, 
which makes customers more sensitive to the price and value of the service. 
It leads to lower retention rates as customers are more likely to cancel if they 
feel they are not getting the desired impact for the premium price.
4. Engagement: Annual contracts incentivize customers to engage with the 
service. On the other hand, monthly agreements can lead to lower 
engagement as customers may be less committed to using the service.
With recurring revenue services becoming more typical, multi-year contracts are 
becoming more common. The retention rate is generally much higher for annual 
contracts than monthly contracts due to ﬂexibility, commitment, price, and 
engagement. Understanding these factors can help SaaS companies develop 
strategies to improve customer retention.
IMPLICATIONS AND WARNINGS
You may recall our discussion on the structure of models (Section 3.3), where it 
was noted that the lower layers serve as the foundation for all other aspects of 
the business. Conversely, this also implies that choosing an inappropriate 
monetization strategy, or evolving into one that is incompatible, can have 
detrimental consequences.

Although initially considered a minor oversight, you'll soon realize that selecting a 
monetization strategy that doesn't sync with other models, will have far-reaching 
consequences throughout your business. 
Mistake 1. Applying the Wrong Metrics
A common mistake made within the Revenue Model, which can cause a lot of 
problems in later growth stages, is applying metrics from the ownership model 
to a subscription model. 
For example, the win rate of the ownership model for a product sold at a price of 
$500,000 to an Enterprise is 1:3; many sales organizations (incorrectly) assume 
that, therefore, they will need a 3x pipeline for their SaaS funnel based on an 
annual contract size of $24,000. These are 2 very different worlds, each with 
their own metrics. The win rate of an annual subscription deal based on a 
$24,000 is 1:5, thus requiring a 5x pipeline. This is a common scenario where a 
company targets the incorrect amount of inbound leads. And as we just learned, 
it does not stop there—this impacts the retention rate, velocity, etc. 
This results in an incorrect Growth Formula.
Mistake 2. Changing the Monetization Strategy Mid Flight
Businesses may change their monetization strategy mid ﬂight. This can be the 
result of acquisition, or a business decision. For example, when transitioning 
from a perpetual software offering to a SaaS offering. 
This transition is reﬂected by moving along the arc from left to right in the 
Revenue Model. Alternatively, they may shift from a monthly to an annual SaaS 
contract, thus moving from right to left along the arc in the Revenue Model.
In doing so, they will encounter various changes, not only in how they price but 
also in how they sell. In addition, these changes will have far-reaching effects on 
the revenue ﬂow, affecting revenue metrics including but not limited to the sales 
cycle, win rate, retention, adoption, and total contract length.

A scientiﬁc approach means you need to be aware of the impact of the 
changes, be able to share these changes with the organization, reason 
if this is the effect the business wants and, if so, determine the action plan 
to make it a reality. Changes to the Revenue Model generally fall into one of 3 
categories:
● Changing a monetization strategy: From a monthly to an annual 
subscription, or vice versa.
● Adding a GTM motion with a new monetization strategy: Transition from a 
use-based PLG offering to an Enterprise-wide annual subscription.
● Launching a new product: Launch an annual subscription for a software 
solution that accompanies a piece of hardware that is paid up front.

the shift successful. A change of executives during this period can be highly 
disruptive. One of the most successful change of monetization strategies was 
performed by Adobe, and it took several years.

In 2011, Adobe, a prominent provider of digital design software, 
experienced a signiﬁcant valuation increase. Previously, Adobe's products 
were sold as one-time software licenses, allowing indeﬁnite use. Their 
Creative Suite became highly proﬁtable, generating over $3.4 billion in 
revenue with a gross margin of 97%. Despite this success, Adobe faced 
challenges keeping up with industry trends. Frequent software updates 
created a never-ending cycle of upgrades, frustrating loyal users who had 
to pay for minimal changes. To address this, in 2011, Adobe transitioned 
to a subscription-based service (SaaS) model. This shift required cultural, 
technological, and business practice changes. They developed a 
cloud-based infrastructure to support the software, ensuring customer 
data security. Sales and marketing strategies were also modiﬁed to 
attract and retain subscribers.

By 2014, 3 years after the launch of the subscription service, revenues 
from subscriptions surpassed license revenue, reaching $2.1 billion and 
$1.6 billion, respectively. Although the business initially incurred losses, 
Adobe turned the corner in 2016 and continued to innovate and evolve its 
products to meet customer needs in the ever-changing technology 
landscape.

Like Adobe, a company sometimes wishes to shift from one monetization

shifts in monetization strategy can precipitate considerable challenges:
● Transitioning from an ownership to a subscription model, as exempliﬁed by 
Adobe's experience, a process that required a minimum of 3 years for 
successful implementation.
● Shifting from a subscription to a consumption model to enhance lead 
ﬂow by leveraging lower price points.
Adobe is now one of the most successful SaaS companies in the world. 
At the end of 2022, Adobe's value was a whopping $150 billion based on 
an annual recurring revenue of $17 billion, a multiple of 8.8x.

● Moving from a consumption to a subscription model, a strategy aimed 
at securing larger transaction volumes to support vendors in meeting their 
growth targets.
● The evolution from a freemium to a paid model, particularly the 
consumption model, represents one of the most challenging transitions 
in monetization strategy, often consuming its users. In June 2023, a public 
discord erupted after Reddit, a social media platform hosting various 
specialized forums, imposed fees on third-party apps. This move angered 
users who rely on these apps for an enhanced Reddit experience.

Mistake 3. Multiple Monetization Strategies
We have run into companies with multiple revenue models that cause lots 
of confusion with a customer. As you can see in the ﬁgure below, this particular 
company operated 4 different monetization strategies. The standard fare was an 
annual subscription model with a monthly option sold at a 20% premium. In 
addition, this company offered consumption based on a usage 
fee, but they had several customers that demanded an on-prem solution 
that could be plugged into their network. All in all, they had 4 different 
monetization strategies. 
At this point, it seems obvious not to do this—but growing this over 10 years and 
with big enough customer names behind it is much more common than most 
people think. Microsoft for example, as of August 2023, still confuses customers 
by selling Oﬃce both under a perpetual as well as a subscription model.

Mistake 4. Mistaking Re-Occurring Revenue for Recurring Revenue.
There is a clear distinction between "recurring" and "re-occurring" revenue; 
understanding this difference is crucial as it signiﬁcantly impacts the 
monetization strategy and thus the valuation.
● Recurring: The term "recurring" implies that something happens 
repeatedly and consistently, following a predictable pattern with regular 
intervals. For example, a SaaS (Software as a Service) contract that 
requires payment on the 1st day of every month is a recurring revenue 
model. It signiﬁes a systematic and ﬁxed pattern where customers are 
regularly billed for continued access to the product or service.
● Re-occurring: On the other hand, "re-occurring" suggests that something 
happens again but lacks the same level of regularity or predictability. It 
implies sporadic or occasional repetition rather than a consistent and 
predetermined pattern. In the context of revenue, re-occurring revenue 
refers to income that may occur repeatedly but without a recurring 
schedule. It can vary in amount and frequency.
But, the distinction between recurring and re-occurring revenue is not solely 
about whether payments happen repeatedly but rather about customers’ 
ongoing access to the product or service as long as they continue to pay. Hence, 
it creates a regular and predictable revenue stream.
5.3.4
The difference between recurring and re-occurring revenue comes down to regularity 
over time and the predictability of the amount of revenue.

Understanding the distinction between recurring and re-occurring revenue is 
essential for businesses to evaluate their revenue models, predict cash ﬂow, and 
determine their overall value in the market. Companies can build a more stable 
and sustainable business model with a predictable income stream by focusing 
on recurring revenue. This carries a higher valuation driving more and more 
companies to categorize their revenue as recurring where in fact it is 
re-occurring.
A few common questions to clarify what is and what is not recurring:
Q: Is an on-prem support contract a recurring revenue subscription?
A: No, it's not. While it may involve recurring payments, it primarily covers 
maintenance and support services for physical devices. This is categorized 
as "re-occurring" revenue.
Q: Is an insertion order (ad tech) considered a subscription model?
A: No, it's not. An insertion order represents a one-time agreement for a 
speciﬁc advertising campaign. However, if the customer allocates and 
spends their budget regularly within the insertion order, the revenue is 
considered re-occurring. Therefore this is categorized as a consumption 
model.
Q: Is usage-based consumption considered a subscription model?
A: Yes, it is. Customers are billed based on their actual usage or 
consumption of a product or service, such as cloud computing or 
telecommunications. It aligns with the subscription concept, where 
customers pay for what they use.

If your numbers are not in the ballpark, assess whether:
● You used a metric based on a different monetization strategy.
● The average performance of the team meets your expectations.
● The market dynamics have changed recently.
If you are off, no need to panic. We simply want to raise the awareness of how 
your revenue factory is supposed to work. In the following chapters, we will 
show you how to design it step by step.
Do you operate in more than one monetization strategy?
For example, if you run a business with less than $100M in recurring revenue, you 
should not have different products with varying types of monetization strategy, such 
as an ownership and. a subscription approach. You may have different approaches 
within the monetization type—for example, a monthly vs. annual subscription.
If you operate more than one monetization strategy, we recommend you focus 
on one monetization strategy with at max 3 GTM motions (see Chapter 10).
Are you using the right metrics for the chosen monetization strategy?
For example, are you operating around the right metrics as part of your monetization 
type? A common mistake here is that companies with a subscription product that 
sells for $20,000 to $50,000 per year operate against a funnel size based on a 1:3 win 
rate, whereas it should operate against a funnel based on a 1:5 win rate.
Make sure you use the right benchmark data, relevant to your monetization 
strategy (see Chapter 6.)
Is your revenue approach aligned across all GTM functions? 
For example, a common problem is the mixing of characteristics from different 
revenue approaches across departments: the company is selling monthly 
subscriptions, but sales are still working on a 3x pipeline (ownership), and the 
customer success team is reporting annual retention numbers, whilst the marketing 
team spends most of its resources on lead generation vs. customer marketing.
We recommend that you start based on the principles of recurring revenue, 
implement a Bowtie across all customer facing roles, and establish impact as a 
uniform language (see Chapter 8).
By now, you should have a basic understanding of the Revenue Model and a 
sense of your business's operational needs.

RECAP OF THE REVENUE MODEL
The Revenue Model provides a framework that helps us understand 
the relationship between the various monetization types and outlines 
the speciﬁc characteristics of each type. There are 3 fundamental 
monetization strategies:
● Ownership, in which the buyer pays the total amount due up front.
● Subscription, which is based on a recurring revenue approach.
● Consumption, which is based on a per outcome basis, such as 
usage or other action.

Your position within this model determines the characteristics of your 
monetization strategy. As we transition along the arc from an ownership-based 
strategy to a subscription-based strategy, and ultimately to a 
consumption-based strategy, the following changes occur:
● A radical shift from selling value to delivering impact. Customers initially buy 
based on value promised but they renew based on the impact received.
● A shift of who takes on the risk from the buyer to the seller. It has become 
the seller who takes on the lion’s share of the risk, and who must be cautious 
about choosing their customers.

● The drop in price by an order of magnitude drives up the demand for a higher 
volume of leads to maintain the same growth metrics. Notably, organizations 
that fail to recognize the source of this increased demand will constantly ﬁnd 
themselves in need of more leads.
● A decrease in the win rate further escalates the need for leads, often leading 
to ongoing tension between marketing and sales departments.
● As we move to the right along the arc, the acquisition velocity increases from 
months to days, and in some cases to seconds. This increase is driven by 
consecutive acceleration of lead generation and opportunity conversion. 
● For retention and expansion, velocity hinges on concurrent acceleration in 
onboarding/activation, adoption, and expansion phases. All these are 
contingent on the customer realizing impact more rapidly.
● In the Ownership monetization strategy the retention theoretically is 100%. 
However, as we progress along the arc, there is a noticeable decline in 
retention, underscoring the need for an ever-increasing number of 
users/customers.
The characteristics of a recurring revenue factory reveal that organizations 
cannot sustainably scale subscription and consumption-based strategies 
through marketing and sales efforts alone. Sustainable growth increasingly 
depends on the active involvement of users and customers, particularly their 
ability to derive the promised value (impact) from the product. This will affect all 
models that are layered on top.
Choices made in the monetization strategy will propagate to all models on top.FIGURE 5.20

Revenue Architecture is a discipline that ensures:
● The chosen monetization strategy provides the best growth opportunity for 
the business in the coming years.
● Alignment of all business parts around the appropriate metrics, based on the 
chosen monetization strategy.
● Avoidance of common mistakes in recurring revenue businesses, such as a) 
an excessive focus on acquisition and b) reliance on growth metrics from an 
ownership-based monetization strategy.
● Alignment of all Go-To-Market team members. For example, ensuring the 
customer success team is aware of and understands their role in the chosen 
approach to achieve the desired results: help the customer achieve recurring 
impact.
The Revenue Model described in this chapter will allow you to educate the 
rest of the company about where you are and where you are not. The beauty of 
the Revenue Model lies in its simplicity; it provides guidance and serves as a 
starting point for any organization aiming to build a revenue factory with a 
uniﬁed GTM approach. 
Once you have structured your monetization strategy within the Revenue Model, 
it is time to move on to the Data Model.

In 1898, Elias St. Elmo Lewis developed a model that mapped a theoretical 
customer’s journey from the moment a brand or product attracted their attention 
to the point of action or purchase. He created a 4-stage process: Awareness, 
Interest, Desire, and Action, commonly known as AIDA.
Potential customers are introduced to your product or service during the 
Awareness stage. In the Interest stage, they learn more about it and consider 
whether it is a good ﬁt for them. In the Desire stage, they are convinced that your 
offering is the best solution for their needs. In the ﬁnal stage, they take action 
and make a purchase. In the 1992 cult classic "Glengarry Glen Ross," 
Alec Baldwin famously depicted the AIDA model to obtain contract signatures 
from prospective clients, "...to sign on the line which is dotted."
One hundred and twenty-ﬁve years after Elias St. Elmo ﬁrst wrote about AIDA in 
his book The New Thought in Advertising, most marketing and sales 
organizations still operate on a derived version of AIDA, now known as the 
marketing and sales funnel, which ends with the buyer making a purchase. 
Although the seller's journey ends with the purchase, this is where the buyer's 
journey starts—and if the product or service delivers on its promise, this journey 
can last for years.
In a subscription business, what happens after the deal closes is what secures 
revenue, growth, and proﬁts. Unfortunately, this is not covered in the classic 
marketing and sales funnel, which was developed for an ownership-based

monetization strategy. The subscription business needs a new model that 
extends the classic marketing and sales funnel to cover the customer journey. 
We will refer to this as the Bowtie or the Data Model. This chapter breaks down 
the Bowtie into 3 parts:
● Part 1. The Data Model: Covers the entire customer journey and refers to the 
complete set of experiences and interactions that a customer goes through 
when engaging with a company or brand. It encompasses various customer 
stages, from initial awareness to considering, purchasing, implementing, and 
using a product or service until it has achieved its full potential.
● Part 2. The Data Structure: Provides a measurement standard and 
framework for organizing and analyzing data. It tells us what we can 
measure and where, which allows us to compare GTM motions against each 
other.
● Part 3. The Benchmark: A reference or standard for comparing and 
analyzing industries and domains. While the Data Model provides a 
framework and structure for organizing and analyzing data, the benchmark 
allows companies to measure their performance, identify gaps or 
opportunities for improvement, and compare themselves against industry 
peers or best practices.
THE DATA MODEL
Up to this point, we have learned that the classic marketing and sales funnel 
ends where recurring revenue begins. Therefore, we extended the funnel into a 
Bowtie. Chapter 4 described the structure of the Data Model and the use of the 
Bowtie to map the customer journey in stages. Building on that model, we will 
now delve into why this approach is customer-centric and how it facilitates a 
shift to impact-based thinking. This shift is crucial for operationalizing 
customer-centric thinking in real-world scenarios.

The Balance Between Value and Impact 
In Section 5.2.1, we examined how Value and Impact correspond to different 
revenue models: Value is tied to acquisition and ownership monetization, while 
Impact is pivotal to retention and expansion in consumption and subscription 
models. The transition from offering Value to ensuring Impact can be visualized 
by moving the business's gravitational center. 
This metaphor illustrates that the subscription model represents an equilibrium 
between Value and Impact. Real-world scenarios support this, showing that even 
successful companies, using a consumption-based model, often have to add an 
annual subscription offering to sustain business growth, balancing immediate 
acquisition with long-term customer retention. The Bowtie model isn't just a 
conceptual tool; it's a custom-designed system for recurring revenue, embracing 
everything we love from the classic marketing and sales funnel.

In this context, purchasing a car represents the Value mindset associated with 
an ownership model. The salesperson emphasizes the car's potential during the 
sale. However, the car owner must undertake all the work (fueling, driving, and 
parking) to realize this value. In this analogy, using a rideshare gets you to the 
same spot but without all the work; this is an Impact approach, using a 
consumption model. The shift from a salesperson selling a car at a dealer to a 
rideshare driver dropping off a customer highlights the signiﬁcant transition from 
a seller-centric value proposition to a customer-centric focus on impact.
The Shift to Impact-Based Thinking
To become customer-centric, organizations must shift their mindset from a 
Value-based perspective to an Impact-based perspective, focusing on delivering 
the customer with the Impact they promised. In other words, they have to shift 
their attention to the right side of the Bowtie. Although it may seem that this 
does not help with shareholder value at ﬁrst glance, it does very much so. In a 
business that relies on recurring revenue, the customer-centric approach 
perfectly aligns with the shareholder’s interest: increase revenue. As we have 
learned from First Principles, revenue growth is based on retaining your (best) 
customers. Retention is grounded in delivering recurring Impact because the 
more Impact you provide, the more likely the customer is to expand their 
business with you. This ultimately increases the customer lifetime value, and 
therefore long term revenue growth as well. 
Operationalizing Customer-Centricity
Now that we have established that delivering recurring impact for a customer 
unlocks recurring revenue, the steps to achieve that become clearer: is the 
customer using the product? In other words, are you achieving adoption? If not, 
you have to put efforts in place to achieve that. If we go further upstream, we 
can now ask, “Were you able to attain the ﬁrst Impact in the ﬁrst place?” And as 
we go even further upstream, it now leads us to ask, "What Impact did we 
commit during the close, and by when?" The journey mapped back from what 
the customer wants to achieve suddenly aligns all the company's resources. 
This applies equally to a business that sells products and services under a $1M 
annual SaaS contract as well as a $10/month subscription.

THE DATA STRUCTURE
Now that we’ve established the Data Model as customer-centric, we can 
overlay a structure that consists of the following elements:
● Volume metrics (VM [n]) measure the quantity of leads, deals, meetings, 
and wins.
● Conversion metrics (CR [n]) measure how many inputs are needed to 
generate desired outputs.
● Time metrics (Δtn) measure how long it takes to convert input into output.
The structure of the data is straightforward. We will look at every system 
or sub-system as a function with an input and an output. Each input and output 
is considered a volume metric, such as the number of leads. Dividing the output 
by the input provides a conversion metric. The time it takes for the input to 
convert into output is the associated time metric. 
As simple as this data structure is, it solves many of the daily problems created 
when organizations are dealing with a common metric such as win rate. In this 
case, sales is a sub-system of the acquisition process. It has an output called 
"Commits" and an input called "Qualiﬁed Opportunities." This means that the 
conversion rate, called win rate, is the number of Commits divided by the total of 
Qualiﬁed Opportunities.

Simple right? It also establishes clarity around where to measure the sales cycle; 
per the standardized data structure, this is the time it takes to convert a qualiﬁed 
opportunity into a commitment.
Volume Metrics
Volume metrics measure quantity at any given point in the Bowtie model. 
Common volume metrics are the number of leads, amount of revenue, number 
of active users, etc.

Between the Education and Selection stages, we introduce a vital phase called 
Prioritization. This stage focuses on ensuring that both parties—the buyer and 
the seller—align their efforts and mutually commit to the desired impact that 
needs to be achieved. This intervention is timely, as the selection process is 
where companies typically allocate their most expensive resources, namely 
people. This phase may include an on-prem product demo or even a proof of 
concept project that can span weeks. Thus, the Prioritization stage acts as a 
strategic checkpoint, ensuring that the objectives of both the seller and the buyer 
are in alignment. In PLG this takes mere seconds as users sample the product.

By deﬁning what is being measured, the data structure overlaid on the Data 
Model becomes independent of the terminology used across different GTM 
motions. A standardized data structure is created by referring to each of these 
moments along the customer journey as a Volume Metric, or VM [n] for short. 
We start with n = 1 and number upwards sequentially.
Doing this helps when using multiple GTM motions, each using speciﬁc 
terms. For example, what is called a Marketing Qualiﬁed Lead (MQL) in an 
inbound GTM motion may be referred to as a product qualiﬁed lead (PQL) in 
a product-led growth GTM motion, both of which we standardize as VM2. A 
Sales Accepted Lead (SAL) in an inbound GTM motion is now called Volume 
Metric 4 (VM4) in the standardized data structure.

Deﬁnition of the Volume Metrics in the standardized Data Model.TABLE 6.1
You will notice that the metrics on the left side of the Bowtie (VM1 to VM5) are 
commonly measured in numbers, such as the number of leads, opportunities, 
discovery calls, seats sold, etc. In contrast, the metrics on the right side of the 
Bowtie (VM6 to VM9) are commonly measured in revenue.

C H A P T E R   0 6   |   D A T A   M O D E L
The transition from the left side of the Bowtie (numbers) to the right side of the 
Bowtie (revenue) is caused by multiplying the number of the Mutual 
Commitments (VM5) by the average contract value, or ACV, to give users 
the amount committed (VM6).
The Challenges of Collection, Normalization, and Veriﬁcation
It's worth noting that collecting this data is no simple task. Aggregating 
information from multiple sources is the norm. For example, VM1 and VM2 
usually come from a marketing automation system, VM3 and VM4 may originate 
from an email automation tool and VM5 and VM6 are mainly sourced from a 
CRM and supplemented with a revenue intelligence tool. VM7 to VM9 
are gathered from either a Customer Management System, a CRM, or 
combined with billing software.
But the work doesn't stop after you've aggregated the data. Before using it, 
the data must be normalized to ensure that different datasets are interoperable. 
And then, when you think you're done, you might ﬁnd yourself in a meeting where 
someone questions the data's accuracy, asking, "Where did you get that data? It 
doesn't match what I'm seeing in the ﬁeld."
In summary: The goal of the standardized data structure is to separate 
nomenclature from any speciﬁc tool or method, allowing us to normalize data 
across motions and compare performance. This creates clarity and allows the 
operations team to manage the database effectively.

The historic data model (L2O, OTC, and churn) mapped to a standardized data structure.
However, it's important to note that traditional metrics like L2O and OTC lack 
the granularity needed for high velocity GTM motions, such as product-led 
growth (PLG). Therefore, as illustrated in the accompanying diagram, both L2O 
which equals to multiplying CR1 and CR2, and OTC which equals multiplying 
CR3 and CR4, have been further reﬁned to offer more detailed insights, enabling 
you to optimize more effectively.

Conversion Metrics
Conversion metrics are key indicators that measure eﬃciency across the 
customer journey. Essentially, they quantify the output in relation to the input. 
For instance, if you're in sales, you're likely familiar with conversion metrics 
like win rate and churn. In marketing, you might be accustomed to metrics 
such as lead to opportunity (L2O) and opportunity to close (OTC).

A Note on Expansion (CR8)
Expansion is a crucial growth component for any company using a recurring 
revenue model. It reﬂects the ability to drive revenue growth from existing 
accounts, increasing the customer’s Lifetime Value (L TV). By continuously 
expanding the usage of the SaaS solution within the customer base, you can 
achieve sustainable revenue growth and enhance customer success. When done 
correctly, growth from expansion comes at a much lower cost compared to 
growth from acquisition.
Expansion can take 4 forms:
● Upselling: Upselling involves selling additional products, features, or 
higher-tier plans to existing customers. This can include offering add-ons, 
premium features, increased usage limits, or more advanced functionality 
that aligns with the customer's evolving needs. Upselling aims to

increase the customer's investment and the value they derive from the 
SaaS solution. Upselling may also include geographical expansion or 
annual price increases.
● Cross-selling: Cross-selling refers to selling complementary or 
related products or services to a different set of stakeholders within an 
existing customer. This can involve targeting other teams, departments, 
or business units within the customer's organization. For example, ESPN, 
Disney Parks, and ABC television are 3 different groups within
The Walt Disney Company.
● Renewal and Extension: Successful renewal of contracts and extending 
the subscription period with existing customers contribute to expansion. 
This involves maintaining customer satisfaction, delivering ongoing value, 
and ensuring a smooth renewal process. Contract extensions may 
include adjustments to the subscription's terms, duration, or scope to 
accommodate the customer's changing needs. Renewals typically occur 
automatically on or right before the anniversary of the contract. Factors 
that increase the chances of renewals include delivering recurring impact, 
a smooth renewal process, a fantastic user interface, intuitive navigation, 
responsive functionality, and customer satisfaction, particularly the speed 
with which issues are addressed.
● Reselling: Reselling is often overlooked, yet it holds both the most signiﬁcant 
threat and the most tremendous potential. Reselling occurs when the current 
Champion, alpha user, or decision-maker leaves their role, say, to accept a 
job elsewhere. This creates a signiﬁcant threat as the new person in the 
position may be tasked with reducing operational expenses and may not 
have an emotional connection to your product. Therefore, you need to "resell" 
this person immediately. Don’t overlook the opportunity for your Champion 
to become a great advocate in gaining the new account.
Two variables inﬂuence the growth of a customer's business: a) the impact of 
the SaaS solution and b) the person or team who beneﬁts from that impact, also 
known as the benefactor.
168

## Page 169

C H A P T E R   0 6   |   D A T A   M O D E L
An excited benefactor increases the impact, for example, by buying more 
seats, upgrading to a more premium version of your software, or buying new 
products. This is considered an upsell. CSMs may be capable of doing this 
reactively. Still, if you want to reach out proactively, you will likely need an 
acquisition-focused salesforce, often referred to as Account Managers or 
as you may have picked up, AMs. When a new benefactor in an existing account 
needs to be won over, this is referred to as a cross-sell. A cross-sell should never 
be handled by a CSM as this is the most complicated sale. You may even need 
to uproot an existing competitor chosen by another Champion.
One of the most overlooked opportunities is the resell. When your Champion 
leaves their position, perhaps via promotion, it creates a vacuum for a new 
Champion to ﬁll. Your team must immediately resell the new person on the 
offerings beneﬁts or face an instant increased risk of churning. An exciting part 
of the resell opportunity is that if it involves your Champion leaving to join 
another company, this creates an opportunity to win a new deal.

Time Metrics
Time metrics are used to measure the duration it takes to transform one variable 
into another. However, what sets the time metrics apart in the GTM motion is 
their focus. They are not determined by the actual duration of an activity, but 
rather by the waiting time between various actions. To illustrate, writing an email 
invite for an event might only take a few minutes, but receiving a response could 
take several days. Therefore, in this context, the time metric is reﬂective of the 
response time, rather than the action time.

Two Different Ways to Approach Time: Go Fast or Go Long
There are 2 ways to approach time; sellers commonly want to speed up time 
during acquisition, i.e., shorten the sales cycle. Whereas during Expansion, 
sellers commonly want the customer to stay longer, extending the customer's 
lifetime. As we will see, time has a disproportionate impact, meaning that 
increasing a customer's lifetime may disproportionately increase a seller's proﬁt.

This is a fundamental difference that is experienced by a customer based on 
who calls on them. An AM is more akin to looking at the customer's interest to 
protect and maximize revenue over the customer's lifetime. In contrast, a more 
conventional sales manager looks to close a deal quickly. The table below shows 
the basic deﬁnitions of the metrics. It is critical to deﬁne this for your business 
as this commonly leads to confusion and causes acceleration where we need to 
take it slow and where we need to respond quickly.

Not all time metrics are created equal. One that stands out is the response time 
to an inbound inquiry (Δt1). The faster you respond, the higher the likelihood of 
converting the lead into a customer. A timely response will give you an edge over 
competitors in highly competitive markets. A delayed response will increase the 
risk of the customer going with a competitor. This not only applies to new leads 
but also to customers, with the onboarding process duration (Δt6) being a key 
example. If it takes days to weeks to onboard a customer, the onboarding churn 
rate will increase.

Using Metrics to Analyze Performance
While conversion metrics focus on transforming one volume metric into 
another, performance metrics can transcend domains, providing us with deep 
insights into the recurring revenue system's performance. For instance, dividing 
Committed MRR [$] by Deals Committed [n] allows us to calculate the average 
price per deal, and comparing the high win rate to the low retention rate can 
indicate if the sales team is overselling. Performance metrics enable us to 
measure performance across various sub-systems. Let's examine 2 performers, 
Rob and Jennifer, side by side and observe the multiple performance metrics at 
play.
From a sales performance metrics perspective, Rob outperforms Jennifer in 
terms of win rate, resulting in 5 deals per month and generating $300,000 in 
revenue against his quota. In contrast, Jennifer only closes 3 deals and achieves 
$198,000 in revenue with the same number of opportunities. However, upon 
closer inspection, we discover that Jennifer has signiﬁcantly higher onboarding 
retention and that her net revenue retention over the next 5 years is 1.2, 
compared to Rob's 0.9. As a result, Jennifer's deals yield nearly $1.5 million over 
a 5-year horizon, whereas Rob's deals amount to $1.1 million. After conducting 
an interview, we learn that Jennifer proactively ﬁlters out unfavorable 
opportunities early on and dedicates more time to educating customers.
While we cannot disregard the $270,000 in revenue secured by Rob in the ﬁrst 
year, we must also acknowledge the additional $367,760 in revenue generated 
by Jennifer. Therefore, by using performance metrics we can see that there is 
not necessarily one clear, black-and-white ideal scenario; Rob performs better on 
initial deal revenue, while Jennifer performs better on L TV.

The key lies in identifying areas for improvement within the system. In this 
example, Rob can learn from Jennifer to take more time and qualify and educate 
the customer, orchestrating for a higher retention and NRR, while Jennifer can 
learn from Rob how to win more deals. There are a number of metrics that each 
impact each other. The Data Model provides us with a scientiﬁc tool to identify 
areas of improvement and implement processes to drive progress. 
The interplay of metrics across marketing, sales, and customer success 
functions creates a spectrum of scenarios, ideal for AI application. Next we will 
explore an example of how AI can optimize scenarios throughout the entire 
customer journey.

Use of Metrics to Create a Performance Improvement Process
In the case of a 2-stage organization, the sales development rep (SDR) 
uses email exchanges to set up a call, resulting in a 15-minute conversation 
with the client who agreed to a discovery call with the sales manager or AE. We 
will use 2 conversion rates, CR3 and CR4, to create an improvement process. In 
this case:
CR3 (Prioritization) refers to the number of qualiﬁed opportunities accepted 
by the Account Executive (AE) divided by the total number of discovery 
meetings set up by the Sales Development Representative (SDR). As a 
quality metric, CR3 reveals the lead quality generated by the team.
In the classic marketing and sales approach, this was determined based on 
access to budget and the potential for a positive ROI. However, in 
subscription and consumption businesses, this criterion shifts since these 
models are designed to yield an immediate and large ROI and ﬁt within an 
OPEX-based budget. Therefore, CR3 primarily assesses the customer's 
priority for the project. More details on this can be found in Section 8.2.3.
With that said, it is important to note that CR3 is not expected to be 100% 
because plenty of leads commit to a meeting but never show. This can be 
due to persistent SDR efforts, a buyer being too busy, a lack of perceived 
need for the Impact, or the project not having any priority.
● CR4 (Win rate) is the number of qualiﬁed opportunities it takes for an AE to 
gain a commitment from a customer. The win rate gives us an idea of the 
competitiveness in the solution market and the seller's skills. CR4 is not 
expected to be 100%, far from it. The customer may choose to stick with the 
status quo, go with a competitor, invest the money elsewhere, or 
keep delaying the decision indeﬁnitely.
While each of these conversion rates provides valuable insights individually, 
however when we combine them into a 3x3 matrix they demonstrate all kinds of 
opportunities for an improvement process.

The performance improvement process illustrated in the 3x3 matrix is an ideal 
representation of how an AI system can create a closed-loop system. While the 
matrix presents 3 distinct win rate scenarios vs 3 different priorities, resulting in 
9 scenarios, an AI system in real-world applications has the capability to 
increase the granularity, essentially evolving to an [n] x [m] level of complexity. 
This allows for more precise and tailored strategies.
BENCHMARK MODEL
Based on the Data Model, we now have the ability to standardize metrics that 
compare performance against industry standards, peers, or ourselves over time. 
Historically, the challenge is that industry benchmarks lack a standardized Data 
Model; e.g. the data was not normalized. Or the data was outdated, etc. 
Today the benchmark data based on the Bowtie format is being used throughout 
the industry, allowing companies to compare subsets of data, by a speciﬁc 
conversion metric, such as a function of time, segment, etc.

The combination of conversion rates creates a performance improvement process. FIGURE 6.7

Benchmark Data
Benchmark data can be utilized to identify areas for performance improvement 
within an organization. For instance, if an organization's speciﬁc conversion rate 
falls below the benchmark, it can use the data to pinpoint the speciﬁc problem 
area and implement an improvement plan. 
Moreover, benchmark data aids in setting goals. For example, if an 
organization's sales performance lags behind the benchmark, a goal to 
increase sales by a speciﬁc percentage can be established. But benchmark 
data allows for progress tracking as well. By comparing performance against the 
benchmark, organizations can gauge both areas of progress and areas 
that require improvement.
One type of benchmark is an industry-wide benchmark, which provides average 
data from a broad dataset sourced from various industries over an extended 
period. While an industry benchmark offers a general understanding of 
performance, by nature it lacks the level of accuracy to operate a recurring 
revenue factory. But it can be enough data to help sketch out a plan.

Use of an Industry Benchmark to Sketch Out an Operational Plan (Application)
Imagine you are a SaaS company targeting Enterprise customers with a product 
that has an annual contract value of $80,000. Your sales model operates without 
SDRs and relies solely on a team of ﬁeld sales representatives, selling to 
executive-level stakeholders. SDRs have previously proven to be ineffective, and 
therefore each seller has the responsibility of generating one third of their total 
leads through their own leadership development efforts. Those efforts are 
supplemented by a targeted Account-Based Marketing (ABM) campaign run by 
the marketing department.
To create an operational plan for the sales team, you refer to the industry 
benchmark in Table 6.5. According to the benchmark, for an ACV of $80,000, the 
conversion rate from opportunity to commitment is calculated by multiplying 
CR3 and CR4, or 95% x 30%, resulting in a conversion rate of 28.5%. We are 
combining conversion rates CR3 and CR4 due to the absence of SDRs.
Considering that the organization pays its sellers $200,000, on target, to 
generate $480,000 in recurring revenue annually. Each seller needs to secure 6 
commitments per year. With a conversion rate of 28.5%, this translates to 
requiring 21 opportunities per year. With one-third of the opportunities 
generated, they have to produce 7 opportunities. Based on an L2O conversion 
rate of 20%, they need to develop 35 leads annually. The remaining 14 
opportunities are generated through ABM lead generation campaigns, with a 
conversion rate of CR1 x CR2 = 10% x 20% = 2%. This means that the marketing 
team would need to prospect 700 accounts per year per salesperson to generate 
the remaining 14 opportunities at a 2% conversion rate.
While this example provides a simpliﬁed illustration, it raises many more 
questions. Factors such as changing market conditions, the relevance of the 
metrics to your speciﬁc market, target stakeholders, compensation plan, and 
organizational structure should all be considered. Ultimately, you will realize that 
relying solely on this data type may not provide the reliability needed to build a 
comprehensive hiring plan. But it tells us that this is not going to be a “walk in the 
park” for the organization. Therefore, a closer look is needed.

Realtime Benchmark Data
An online benchmark featuring the latest metrics is available. 
The goal is to enable contributors to compare speciﬁc Bowtie 
metrics in real time, based on different growth characteristics 
such as ARR and ACV.
Trendline
We have found that people tend to compare their performance against that of 
others within their sphere of inﬂuence. Usually, this comparison is not useful, as 
it is unlikely that the company's data are aligned with their model. This leads to 
large discrepancies.
A more effective method is self-benchmarking using trendlines based on your 
own data, like analyzing performance over the last 12 months (L TM). Trendlines, 
being straightforward aid in understanding, analyzing, and communicating 
performance trends. This process enables informed decisions, effective 
goal-setting, and enhanced performance management.
Example
In late 2019, we collaborated with a client offering a single product through 3 
different GTM motions, each with a different price point:
● Low Touch approach for the SMB market, ACV: $18,000.
● Medium Touch for the Mid-market, ACV: $24,000.
● High Touch for Enterprise, ACV: $48,000.
In this scenario, we analyzed 2 metrics: Quarterly opportunity creation (VM4) 
and win rate (CR4). Over the last 10 quarters, we noticed a consistent trend 
across all GTM motions: An increase in opportunities (VM4) correlated with a 
decrease in win rates (CR4). Looking closer at the SMB win rate (CR4) the 
average appears to be approximately 30%. However, in recent quarters, the win 
rate has been trending downward, reaching as low as 25%, with the current (as 
of the ﬁrst half of 2023) win rate at 26%.

## Page 179

C H A P T E R   0 6   |   D A T A   M O D E L
This means that at a win rate of 30%, the sellers would require 1/0.3 = 3.33 
opportunities to secure one win; at a win rate of 25%, we would therefore need 
1/0.25 = 4.0 opportunities to achieve the same result, or, a 20% increase in 
opportunities. That is a huge difference on an annual scale across 100 sellers, 
and can lead to millions of dollars lost.

Translating this into operations:
On average, a seller in the SMB market closes 8 deals per quarter, 
and there are 10 sellers. Therefore, there would be 10 x 8 = 80 SMB deals 
per quarter under normal circumstances. Historically, this would require 
80/0.3 = 267 leads/quarter. However, due to the decline in the win rate over 
the past quarter, they now need a lot more leads: 80 / 0.2 = 400 leads/quarter, 
to be exact.
The data-driven team at this company operated on trendlines. They noticed 
the decline in the win rate and took corrective action by increasing investment 
in lead generation and lead development. As you can observe, the team 
increased the number of opportunities in the SMB segment. With a historical 
average of around 300, they raised the number of opportunities to 400 in the 
last 2 quarters which stabilized revenue production.

This use case shows that a standardized Data Model facilitates normalized data 
integration across various functions. Trendlines, created from the integrated 
data, enable more precise predictions of future trends and allow for timely 
corrective measures. However the power is in analyzing trendlines for multiple 
volume and conversion metrics throughout the customer journey, we can detect 
performance patterns, take appropriate actions, and establish measurable goals. 
This data driven approach is especially signiﬁcant in recurring revenue contexts, 
where even marginal changes can lead to substantial outcomes. We will delve 
deeper into this topic in Chapter 7.
APPLICATIONS OF THE DATA MODEL
Next, we are going to apply the Data Model by overlaying different GTM motions:
● High Touch for the big deals (see Figure 6.9)
● Medium Touch for high-velocity deals (see Figure 6.10)
● No Touch for high volume of deals (see Figure 6.11)
Each of these GTM motions, and the relationship between them, is detailed in 
Chapter 10, titled “The GTM Model.”
Applying the High Touch GTM Motion to the Data Model
The Enterprise motion in SaaS companies is geared towards securing deals that 
typically range from hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars. These deals 
are often a highlight in the quarterly statements of public SaaS companies. In 
large Enterprise deals, specialized methods such as Account-Based Marketing 
(ABM) are employed, along with unique terminology. For instance, the focus is 
on strategically selecting the right accounts (Targets) and nurturing these 
accounts through advanced campaigns until they become Marketing Qualiﬁed 
Accounts (MQA). Sales using a provocative approach develops this into an 
opportunity.

 Executive 
Referral Expansion
Based on this approach, we can map the data model to the High Touch motion 
as follows: VM1 represents Targets, VM2 represents MQAs, VM3 represents 
Opportunities, and VM4 represents Qualiﬁed Opportunities. However, the High 
Touch GTM motion is not just about methodology and terminology; it operates 
effectively within the Data Model. Here’s how some unique characteristics of 
High Touch GTM motions ﬁt into the Data Model:
● Deal Expansion: Initial deals may be sizable, but they often generate limited 
proﬁt, as the company needs to work hard to fulﬁll its promises. The real 
growth and proﬁt come from business expansion in the years that follow.
● Proof of Concept (POC): The sales cycle can extend over a year, with the 
seller needing to prove that their solution integrates well within the buyer's 
tool stack. This involves a signiﬁcant upfront investment in resources.
● Targeting: Given the substantial resource investment over a long period, it is 
crucial for sellers to carefully select the accounts they wish to pursue.
● Referrals: Lead generation primarily relies on existing customers who 
introduce and advocate for the seller to potential buyers, a process that can 
be facilitated by a Customer Advisory Board (CAB).
This approach creates a customer journey within the data model that aligns with 
the unique characteristics of the High Touch GTM motion.

The Medium Touch GTM Motion Within the Data Model
This GTM motion operates seamlessly within the same Data Model as the High 
Touch GTM motion, although with some distinct characteristics. In this model, a 
lower-cost representative is responsible for both lead generation (outbound) and 
lead development (inbound), setting the stage for a discovery call. This call 
introduces the sales manager, who then qualiﬁes the opportunity and steps 
through the sales process. Like the High Touch motion, the Medium Touch 
motion is rich in acronyms that maps to the Data Model as follows:
● VM2 corresponds to Marketing Qualiﬁed Leads (MQL), prospects who 
provided their email address to attend a webinar.
● VM3 is linked to Sales Qualiﬁed Leads (SQL), following a conversation where 
the buyers show interest in a solution.
● VM4 relates to Sales Accepted Leads (SAL), which comes after a 
qualiﬁcation by the sales rep, akin to what is termed as Qualiﬁed 
Opportunities in the High Touch motion.
The Medium Touch GTM motion, commonly employed for SMB sales, operates 
seamlessly alongside the High Touch GTM motion, typically used for Enterprise 
sales, within the same Data Model. The subsequent ﬁgure (Figure 6.10) 
illustrates the customer journey, highlighting the characteristics of the Medium 
Touch GTM motion.

Characteristics of a Medium Touch GTM motion are:
● Thought Leadership: Due to the dependency on a high volume of deals, 
there is an insatiable hunger for more leads. Thought leadership is used to 
generate leads in volume. An example would be Hubspot and its expertise on 
inbound marketing.
● Email sequencing: Deals develop at a relatively high velocity, with companies 
typically using email sequencing augmented with automation.
● Churn Prevention: The high-velocity motion is sensitive to churning deals, 
and there is often a speciﬁc focus on churn prevention.
● Renewal: The high-velocity business model, with its demand for a large 
customer base, relies heavily on a high renewal rate, where customers keep 
coming back, and remain a client often for up to 8 or 9 years.
The No Touch/Product-Led Growth Motion Within the Data Model
PLG is often misunderstood; it's neither a marketing campaign, a sales 
methodology, nor a lead generation tool. Intrinsic to the product itself, PLG is a 
distinctive motion within the Data Model, bypassing several stages as 
customers themselves drive the product's marketing and sales efforts.
Within the Data Model, PLG encompasses unique descriptions and acronyms, as 
outlined in Figure 6.11:
● VM3 represents PQL (Product Qualiﬁed Lead), indicating a user whose 
engagement with the product signals their readiness to convert into a deal.
● VM4 aligns with PQA (Product Qualiﬁed Account), identifying an account 
with multiple users, presenting an opportunity to sell a team license.
● VM5 is associated with sign ups, referring to users who create an account to 
evaluate the product and assess its impact.
● VM8 denotes Monthly Active Users (MAU), measuring the unique users 
interacting with the software monthly.
PLG's distinct customer journey, with its unique characteristics, seamlessly 
integrates with Medium and High Touch GTM motions when mapped using

the standardized Data Model. This journey includes several PLG-speciﬁc 
characteristics:
● Dependency on a Great Product: Leveraging the product as a marketing 
tool, often through a beta-user program, to naturally generate leads.
● Viral Spread: Passionate users can drive the product's popularity, creating a 
viral effect where the product serves as its own marketing and sales force. 
With in-demand products, such viral spread can occur even before customer 
sign-ups.
● Sign Up Focus: Unlike other GTM motions that focus on acquiring 
customers (logos), the PLG motion uniquely emphasizes getting actual 
product users to sign up.
● Usage: A primary challenge in most PLG GTM motions is sustaining product 
usage, a key indicator of churn. Success metrics such as MAU, and others 
like Weekly Active Users (WAU) and Daily Active Users (DAU), are crucial 
indicators.
The No Touch GTM motion is applicable for both application sales, where 
individual users sign up, and platform sales, where it serves as a fully functional 
sandbox account for the initial user. The following ﬁgure (Figure 6.11) illustrates 
the customer journey within a No Touch GTM motion.

Adherence to the Data Model
For any part of GTM to reap the beneﬁt of AI, you need to establish a 
standardized Data Model that supports closed loops. Therefore, any company 
based on recurring revenue must have a standardized and normalized Data 
Model that covers the entire customer journey. This Data Model must 
be archived for dashboard creation, goal setting, performance measurement, 
improvement processes, or technology integration. 
Once agreed upon, adherence to the standardized Data Model must be enforced. 
Changes are always possible but need to follow a change request process. In 
this process, a person certiﬁed in Revenue Architecture reviews the impact of 
the proposed changes, which can have signiﬁcant consequences for valuation.
COMBINING THE REVENUE AND DATA MODELS
Now that we have covered the ﬁrst 2 models, we can combine the Revenue and 
Data Models. For visual storytelling, we transform the Data Model into a balance 
that can tip to the left or right or remain in balance. An ownership model, which 
focuses on selling value, is reﬂected in the Revenue Model by a leftward tilt, 
causing the Bowtie to tip to the left.

## Page 186

C H A P T E R   0 6   |   D A T A   M O D E L
Both models emphasize the importance of selling value to customers. We deﬁne 
value as the promise of impact, which aligns with the concept of a "value 
proposal." Most marketing and sales funnels, even those of many SaaS 
companies, operate within the value domain, focusing primarily on promising 
impact. With a value-centric approach, it becomes the customer's responsibility 
to achieve the impact. The leftward balance reﬂects the signiﬁcant risk that 
buyers bear in the ownership model. This risk is evident in consumer 
experiences when purchasing a car: once you drive it off the lot, achieving 
impact becomes your responsibility.
Now, let's examine what happens when the Revenue Model points in the 
opposite direction, all the way to the right. Notice that the Bowtie follows suit 
and starts tipping to the right. This alignment signiﬁes the effects of the 
consumption model, centered around delivering impact to the customer.
In the consumption approach, the seller assumes most, if not all, of the risk. 
Earlier we used the example of the ride-sharing industry, where the driver (seller) 
takes on all risks associated with the vehicle, such as parking tickets or damage. 
At the same time, the buyer assumes little to no ﬁnancial risk. However, as we 
will see in the GTM model, while this model allows for early acceleration, the 
economic risks eventually become too signiﬁcant.

At this stage, many of you may be starting to grasp concepts that were once 
unclear and seemed mysterious. Upon reﬂection, you might now recognize 
that the classic marketing and sales funnel only captured the process of the 
ownership monetization strategy, which emphasized closing large deals by 
highlighting value. 
However, to effectively model recurring revenue, a new approach is 
necessary—one based on a standardized Data Model with a data structure that 
differentiates between volume, conversion, time, and performance metrics to 
incorporate public benchmark data. Enter the Bowtie.
OWNERSHIP
SUBSCRIPTION
CONSUMPTION
VALUE IMPACT
VALUE IMPACT
FIGURE 6.14 The subscription monetization strategy distributes risk between seller and buyer more 
evenly, making it one of the most balanced business models in current use.
This leads us to the subscription model, where the risk is balanced between the 
buyer and the seller. We establish this balance through an annual subscription, 
often synonymous with an annual SaaS contract. 
With an annual SaaS contract, a balance exists between the seller's promise of 
value during the acquisition process (left side of the Bowtie) and the buyer's 
expectation for impact (right side). The buyer achieves this impact through 
adoption. If the seller can assist the buyer in realizing such an impact, both 
parties unlock growth through expansion.

Based on this standardized Data Model, we can conduct a benchmark analysis 
to evaluate our performance against others using the same model. It helps us

RECAP OF THE DATA MODEL
At the heart of recurring revenue is the concept that it stems from ongoing 
impact, which lies beyond the classic marketing and sales funnel. In fact, the 
journey of recurring revenue starts where the classic funnel ends. The 
standardized Data Model we've adopted extends this funnel into a Bowtie shape, 
integrating post-commitment activities. This model is bifurcated: the left side 
targets customer acquisition, while the right side focuses on nurturing long-term 
customer relationships. To create the Data Model, we overlay a standardized 
Data Structure which utilizes 3 metrics: Volume Metrics (VM), Conversion 
Metrics (CR), and Time Metrics (t). This forms a Data Structure (The Bowtie 
Metrics) that is layered on top of the Data Model (The Bowtie).

Trendlines not only enable us to forecast future outcomes but also help in 
spotting potential issues early, allowing for preemptive action. The Data Model, 
pivotal across the customer journey, forms the backbone for understanding the 
ﬁnancial viability of the different GTM motions.
The standardization of the data model not only enhances system behavior 
modeling, including closed-loop processes, but also aligns various GTM motions. 
This is particularly vital as organizations grapple with data compliance challenges 
arising from unique terminologies and metrics introduced by new GTM motions. 
Essentially, a standardized Data Model acts as a unifying framework for the entire 
revenue operation, ensuring data consistency and smooth exchange across all 
customer-facing business segments.

In this chapter, mathematics takes center stage as we address a speciﬁc 
blind spot: nonlinearity. We explore its profound impact on the growth trajectory 
of businesses relying on recurring revenue. Through stories, graphics and 
formulas, we unravel the secrets behind the captivating allure of nonlinearity. As 
humans, our emotions often drive irrational choices with nonlinear 
consequences. Consider this chapter a much-needed software upgrade that 
will enhance your understanding. Take time with it, revisiting as needed, as 
each reading unveils new perspectives and broader implications for your 
business. Get ready for an epiphany.

Similarly, Formula 7.2 illustrates the mathematical notation for repeatedly 
multiplying numbers, using the Greek letter Pi. Pi corresponds to “P” in our 
alphabet and is commonly used to represent the product of a series of terms. 
This is akin to the initial sound of the word product: Pi is used in the same way 
as Sigma is described above, except the terms are multiplied instead of added.
y = x(n)
n = 1

y = x(1)  ×  x(2)  ×  x(3)  ×  x(4)  ×  x(5)

y = x(1)  +  x(2)   +  x(3)  +   x(4)  +  x(5)
FORMULA 7-1
Mathematically, the recurring growth engine consists of 2 speciﬁc parts: the 
acquisition part, which is based on repeated additions (∑), and the retention and 
expansion part, which involves adding together (∑) several multiplications (Π).
This implies a different mathematical principle for each side of the Bowtie.
Elements of Accelerated Growth
Would you be surprised to learn that the exponential growth engine behind a 
hypergrowth business model is driven by adding up and multiplying numbers, 
and doing this repeatedly. It is this word, repeatedly, that introduces us to 2 
mathematical notations, referred to as Sigma and Pi.
Formula 7.1 depicts the mathematical notation for repeatedly adding numbers, 
represented by the Greek letter Sigma. Sigma, a capital letter in the Greek 
alphabet, corresponds to “S” in the English alphabet and is used in mathematics 
to denote summation. Essentially, Sigma is analogous to Sum.

In summary: While forms of multiplication occur on both sides of the Bowtie, it's 
during the retention and expansion phase that the results accumulate over the 
months and years, creating a compound impact. Repeated multiplication 
possesses a speciﬁc and unique characteristic: it can lead to nonlinearity. 
Nonlinearity occurs when all conversion metrics experience a similar variation at 
the same time; for example, they all experience a 10% increase in performance.

Nonlinearity
Understanding nonlinearity comes down to understanding the difference 
between y = x × n and y = x ^ n. Think of n as the number of years (for example, 
six) and x as the monthly marginal improvement (say, 15%). Applying n = 6 and x 
= 1.15 to both equations vividly demonstrates the distinction.
y = x × n (linear) 
y = 1.15 × 6 = 6.9
FORMULA 7-3
It is the difference between these 2 formulas that cause confusion. Plotting both 
in a chart helps us visualize the effects of disproportionate impact.
FORMULA 7-4 y = xn (nonlinear)
y = x × x × x × x × x × x 
y = 1.15 × 1.15 × 1.15 × 1.15 × 1.15 × 1.15 = 2.3

Win Rate (CR4)
SUB-SYSTEM

In Figure 7.2, you can observe a disproportionate impact: the same change in x 
(Δx) results in a different change in y (Δy). For instance, extending a customer's 
lifetime by 6 months (Δx), from 12 to 18 months, means that the recurring 
revenue system yields an increase in revenue (Δy = 7). However, if the contract is 
extended by the same 6 months (Δx) a year later, moving from 24 to 30 months, 
the revenue boost is much greater—in this example, 5.3 times the initial increase 
(Δy = 32). This exponential response is key to understanding how operating with 
a recurring revenue model can shift growth from a moderate 10% to an 
extraordinary rate exceeding 40%, known as hypergrowth.
In summary: Nonlinearity refers to a characteristic in which small changes lead 
to disproportionate and often unexpected outcomes. Next, we will examine how 
recurring revenue growth relies on nonlinear effects, including when and where 
these effects occur. We will learn that they manifest differently across the 
acquisition, and similarly the retention and expansion, of revenue.
Nonlinearity in Acquisition
Growth in any company begins with the left side of the Bowtie: acquisition. 
As we saw in the Data Model, acquisition consists of several sub-systems, 
each with its own conversion rate. To help us understand the situation, let’s 
create a block diagram that depicts how we calculate the win rate from the 
number of opportunities.
7.1.3
Win rate depicts a seemingly linear relationship in which the win rate (CR4) equals the 
amount of commits (VM5) divided by the number of qualiﬁed opportunities (VM4).

To calculate the number of Commits delivered by a sales team (output [y]), we 
have to multiply the number of opportunities (input [x]) by the win rate, giving 
us Formula 7-5.
Commits (y) = Number of Qualiﬁed Opportunities (y) × Win Rate (CR4)FORMULA 7-5
Now, compare Formula 7-5 with Formula 7-3, and you'll notice they look the 
same.
y = x × n (linear) FORMULA 7-3
The similarity between Formulas 7-5 and 7-3 leads us to believe that the 
relationship between the number of mutual commitments and the number of 
qualiﬁed opportunities must be linear—this implies that, to win twice as many 
deals, we need to double the number of opportunities. However, when we 
examine what happens in the sub-system, a different picture emerges. Winning a 
deal is the cumulative outcome of many emails, calls, meetings, and many other 
interactions. All of these interactions directly impact the win rate.

For instance, focusing on scheduled meetings, let's say it takes an average of 12 
meetings to gain commitment. Think of a couple of discovery meetings, 
demonstrations, proposal discussions, negotiations, etc. At the end of these 
meetings, the buyer and seller decide whether to move forward or not. This 
means that each meeting has its own conversion rate that contributes to the 
overall win rate, and that small improvements across multiple actions can 
disproportionately impact the win rate. This is known as compound impact.
Commits = Number of Qualiﬁed Opportunities × CR (a) × CR (b) × CR (c) × CR (n) FORMULA 7-6
When assuming the conversion rates (CR) for each meeting to be the same, 
e.g., CR(1) = CR(2) = CR(3) = CR(n), we get Formula 7-7.
Commits = Number of Qualiﬁed Opportunities × CR (n) number of meetings FORMULA 7-7
Now, compare formula 7-7 with formula 7-4, and notice the similarities to the 
nonlinear function which we learned earlier to have a disproportionate effect. 
FORMULA 7-4 y = xn (nonlinear)
This suggests the number of wins is not only determined by the number of 
qualiﬁed opportunities but also on the number of meetings and the conversion 
rate per meeting. This means that something as simple as improving the quality 
of meetings across the board will have a big impact on the win rate and, thus, 
the number of wins. Let's illustrate this with an example: 20 leads result in a 
sales process with an 85% conversion rate (on average) per meeting across 12 
meetings.
201
Commits = Number of Qualiﬁed Opportunities × CR (n) number of meetings 
Commits = 20 × 85% 12 meetings = 2.85
 = 2.85 × $40,000 = $113,793
FORMULA 7-7a

---

## Page 202

C H A P T E R   0 7   |   M A T H E M A T I C A L   M O D E L
An 85% conversion rate across 12 meetings results in 2.85 wins or $113,793 
based on a $40,000 ACV. Doubling leads from 20 to 40 could double revenue, but 
this is challenging and may decrease lead quality. Instead, let's improve the 
conversion rate per meeting from 85% to 90%. What would the impact be?
Commits = 20 × 90% 12 meetings = 5.6
 = 5.6 × $40,000 = $225,944
FORMULA 7-7b
There you have it: by increasing the conversion rate per meeting from 85% to 
90% the result doubles from 2.85 to 5.6, consequently doubling the revenue. And 
increasing meeting success by a small percentage is more reasonable to expect 
and more sustainable than doubling the number of leads. There are numerous 
ways to improve the quality of a meeting, such as starting the meeting on time, 
deﬁning meeting objectives up front, closing the meeting on time and agreeing 
on the next steps. 
However, another variable affects the win rate: the number of meetings. Based 
on Formula 7.5, if we change the number of meetings, we should observe a 
corresponding change in the win rate. Let's examine that by increasing or 
decreasing the number of meetings by 1.
Commits = 20 × 90% 13 meetings = 5.1
 = 5.1 × $40,000 = $203,349
FORMULA 7-7c
Commits = 20 × 90% 11 meetings = 6.3
 = 6.3 × $40,000 = $251,049
FORMULA 7-7d
Wait, what just happened? By reducing the number of meetings, the number of 
wins jumped from 5.6 to 6.3. Not as big as changing the conversion rate per 
meeting, but the effect is still evident. It starts to make sense if you think about it 
for a moment. Remember, 90% raised to the power of 12 is the same as:
20 × 0.9 × 0.9 × 0.9 × 0.9 × 0.9 × 0.9 × 0.9 × 0.9 × 0.9 × 0.9 × 0.9 ×  0.9  = 5.6FORMULA 7-7e

## Page 203

C H A P T E R   0 7   |   M A T H E M A T I C A L   M O D E L
Law of Diminishing Returns: When It Comes to Meetings, Less is More
What we just learned is that every additional meeting reduces the chance of 
winning a deal by 90%. To illustrate this simply, let's say you start with 20 
opportunities; this would typically result in 5.6 wins. However, if you reduce the 
number of meetings by just one, you avoid an extra multiplication by 0.9, 
effectively increasing your wins to 6.3. 
203
This seems counterintuitive, doesn't it? Common sense might suggest that 
decreasing the number of meetings couldn't possibly lead to more Commits. 
The situation is not as straightforward. After a certain point, more emails and 
more meetings yield diminishing returns—or, fewer Commits. This suggests that 
by increasing the quantity of meetings without increasing the quality, it's possible 
that you're harming your chances of getting the Commit. In practical terms, this 
means focusing on having the right people in each meeting which can reduce 
the need for additional meetings and ultimately increase the overall win rate. 
This principle is even more evident in lead development, where the widespread 
use of email sequencing tools combined with AI has led to a signiﬁcant increase 
in the volume of emails sent to prospects which results in diminished 
effectiveness due to over-contacting.
The Impact of Attrition
Lead development and subscriber retention are inﬂuenced by attrition. This 
means an increase in actions inversely impacts success rates. For example, 
sending a prospect twice as many emails does not double the chance of 
converting them into an opportunity; in fact it results in a decrease in success.
The next ﬁgure demonstrates the attrition process in lead development based on 
volumes of email in an email sequence. It depicts 3 scenarios where y 
represents the unsubscription rate and x the number of emails sent in the 
sequence (n). The nature of these curves vividly shows the subscriber retention 
rates to exponentially decline as the frequency of emails rises.
Commits = 20 × 0.9 × 0.9 × 0.9 × 0.9 × 0.9 × 0.9 × 0.9 × 0.9 × 0.9 × 0.9 × 0.9 = 6.3FORMULA 7-7f

How Marginal Gains Can Lead to Hypergrowth
If you ask sales leaders how to double the revenue, most will suggest doubling 
the number of leads. This rational response reﬂects a linear growth mindset, 
explaining why many revenue-driven SaaS companies crave leads and resort to 
volume-based email marketing. However, nonlinearity in attrition demonstrates 
why marketing struggles to deliver against this target, even if they double their 
spend. The problem of linear thinking is so prevalent in hypergrowth companies 
that it often strains the relationship between even the most ardent marketing 
and sales teams. The solution lies in making marginal improvements across the 
entire acquisition process: 10% more leads, 10% better (fewer) emails, 10% more 
effective discovery calls, 10% less discount, and so on. These marginal gains 
compound and, counterintuitively, create a sharp increase in revenue. 
Operators are now capitalizing on a key characteristic of the recurring revenue 
model—its sensitivity to small changes—to boost growth. However, this 
sensitivity also uncovers underlying instability within the system, leading to 
volatility. This important issue is the subject of our next discussion.

Volatility in Acquisition Growth
As shown in Formulas 7.7a and 7.7b, small marginal gains can signiﬁcantly 
impact revenue. However, the reverse is also true: when conversion rates drop 
across the board, revenue decreases disproportionately.

The acquisition system operates as 3 nonlinear sub-systems in an open-loop setup. 
This conﬁguration is known to cause instability and can lead to a runaway system.
FIGURE 7.6
RETENTION AND EXPANSION
Table 7.1 on the next page illustrates a marginal decline in performance for each 
conversion rate across various departments. This scenario is reminiscent of a 
factory setting, where a series of small, seemingly obscure mistakes can 
culminate in a critical problem—in this context, a sharp drop in revenue.
The absence of self-correcting feedback loops in the system exacerbates this 
issue, resulting in a phenomenon known as “running away.” A system runs away 
when it lacks a feedback mechanism, thus it fails to adjust to changes, causing 
its output to increasingly deviate from its intended outcome. Such a scenario is 
especially prevalent in nonlinear systems, where even minor variations can 
trigger disproportionate and unpredictable effects, thereby heightening both the 
likelihood of a “runaway” scenario and severity of the impact.

In the next section, we'll explore the characteristics of the growth engine for 
retention and expansion. Although it operates similarly to the acquisition 
process, it includes closed-loop elements that provide unique stabilizing effects, 
yet it demands a set of unique considerations.
Nonlinearity in Retention and Expansion
Growth from Retention and Expansion works in a similar but different way to 
growth from Acquisition. Both possessing the same attributes such as win rate, 
sales cycle, and average price. They are similar in that in retention, these factors 
are relatively stable: the ‘win rate’ can be as high as 99%, the ‘sales cycle’ is 
determined by the contract length, and the ‘price’ can be predicted with relative 
accuracy. Where growth from retention differs is that it relies on the actual 
delivery against the promises made.
A marginal decline in performance of different conversion rates across departments, 
each operating nonlinearly within an open-loop system, causes a sharp decline in ARR. 
During the Golden Era of SaaS, this running away phenomenon spurred hyper- 
growth. In contrast, during the subsequent economic downturn, the system 
reacted similarly but in reverse, running away again, leading to a rapid, negative 
impact, this time triggering a crash. In both instances the system behaved 
exactly the way it was suppose to, it was the operators who lacked the insight to 
comprehend, predict, and control the system's behavior.

Once a mutual commitment is established between a company and its 
customers, the journey towards expansion unfolds through distinct stages: 
Onboarding, Retention, and Expansion. It’s important to remember that 
“retention” reﬂects the seller-centric perspective and is the result of “adoption,” 
the customer-centric perspective. Progression through these stages is 
measured in terms of time, churn, retention, contraction, and expansion. Each of 
these can be quantiﬁed using numerical values (n), revenue ($) ﬁgures, and as a 
percentage of the total (%).
Retention and 
expansion form 
a closed loop.
Onboarding in this context refers to the onboarding of the customer as a whole, 
not just an individual user, and it operates in a linear fashion. The Retention and 
Expansion stages on the other hand function as a nonlinear sub-system, and it 
forms a closed loop system. As customers purchase and effectively utilize more 
products and services, their contract value increases, driving compound growth. 
However, it's important to note that this compounding effect is not based on the 
number of actions, as it is in acquisition, but rather on the effects of it over time. 
This leads us to GRR and NRR, both of which rely on time to create Lifetime 
Value (L TV).

Revenue Retention
NRR and GRR are 2 commonly used performance metrics indicative of a 
customer's health over time. GRR is a metric that measures the overall 
revenue retained from existing customers without accounting for any 
expansion. It provides a snapshot of the total revenue generated from the 
customer base, including renewals. 
Within the Data Model, CR7 reﬂects GRR (see Figure 7.8), and NRR adds 
revenue growth from existing customers to that. It considers the expansion 
and contraction of revenue within the existing customer base. NRR provides 
insights into the net impact of upsells, cross-sells, downgrades, and churn on 
the overall revenue generated by the customer cohort. Within the Data Model, 
CR7 x CR8 reﬂects NRR, depicted in Figure 7.8. As we have learned GRR and 
NRR form a closed-loop system that feeds on itself and are the core elements 
of any recurring revenue based growth engine. In fact they form the core of the 
hypergrowth engine.
Gross Revenue Retention (GRR)
GRR measures the overall revenue retained from existing customers without 
considering any expansion:
GRR =FORMULA 7-8
MRR(Start) - MRR(Contraction) - MRR(Churn)
MRR(Start)
× 100
For example, let's consider a company with 100 customers, each paying 
$1,000 monthly. Multiplying 100 x $1,000/month results in a monthly recurring 
revenue of $100,000 at the beginning of the month (MRRSTART). Three customers 
cancel their contracts throughout the month (MRRCHURN), and 2 downgrade their 
subscriptions by $500 (MRRCONTRACTION). Based on these changes, the GRR can 
be calculated, resulting in a GRR of 96%.

Net Revenue Retention (NRR)
Similarly, NRR measures revenue growth from existing customers; it is 
crucial in measuring hypergrowth. It considers the churn, expansion, and 
revenue contraction within the existing customer base. NRR provides 
insights into the net impact of upsells, cross-sells, downgrades, and churn 
on the overall revenue generated by the customer cohort. The formula 
for NRR is:
NRR =FORMULA 7-9
MRR(Start)+MRR(Expansion)-MRR(Contraction)-MRR(Churn)
MRR(Start)
× 100
Looking at Figure 7.7, the combination of VM7, CR7, and CR8 within 
the Data Model forms NRR.
● VM7 equals MRRSTART is the revenue at the start of the period.
● CR7 is a multiplication of contraction and retention (normalized).
● CR8 is the expansion as the result of renewals, upsells, and 
cross-sells (normalized).
NRR =FORMULA 7-9a
VM7  x  CR7  x  CR8 
VM7 × 100
The result indicates the net change in revenue from existing customers; it can 
be expressed as a percentage or in revenue. A positive NRR value (above 100%) 
indicates that the company has successfully expanded its revenue from existing 
customers, offsetting any revenue lost due to churn or downgrades. A value 
below 100% suggests a contraction in revenue, meaning that the lost revenue 
from the churn and downgrades exceeds the revenue gained from expansions.
Note that in the next ﬁgure, we are using MRR as the metric of choice. We 
generally recommend using MRR, but you may also use ARR as long as you are 
consistent across the entire customer journey and all GTM motions.

Let’s build on the previous example: A company with 100 customers, each 
paying $1,000 a month, resulting in a monthly recurring revenue of $100,000 
(VM7). Three customers cancel their contracts throughout the month 
(MRRCHURN), and 2 downgrade their subscriptions by $500 (MRRCONTRACTION), but 
12 customers expand their business by $500/month for a total of $6,000. Based 
on these changes, the GRR can be calculated, resulting in a GRR of 96%.
NRR =

It's important to calculate NRR and GRR against a cohort that operates on the 
same GTM motion and starts within the same timeframe. In fact, it's imperative 
to analyze usage metrics such as Monthly Active Users (MAU), Daily Active 
Users (DAU), and retention numbers (GRR/NRR) on a cohort basis to fully 
understand the growth patterns.

NRR and GRR both operate on the same hyperbolic function, but values greater than 1 
versus less than 1 result in different nonlinearities within the ﬁrst 10 years, best 
observed when zoomed out.

The Hypergrowth Engine is Powered by the Nonlinearity of NRR
To better understand how hypergrowth works it is crucial to analyze the behavior 
of GRR and NRR over time. Similar to acquisition, both GRR and NRR follow 
nonlinear curves. However, they each generate distinct responses that 
signiﬁcantly impact long-term outcomes. To illustrate this, we graph the 
mathematical formulas of GRR (0.9x) and NRR (1.1x) and zoom out to fully 
appreciate the distinct shapes of their respective curves.
Focusing on the initial 10 years, a clear divergence emerges: the GRR curve 
shows a decline, whereas the NRR curve rises. This difference is crucial, 
highlighting NRR's integral role in driving the nonlinear acceleration 
characteristic of hypergrowth. For operators, understanding this nonlinearity is 
key to making decisions that unlock the full growth potential of the hypergrowth 
engine. For example, this explains why organizations should dedicate a team to 
expansion (focusing on NRR) much earlier than previously thought.

Lifetime Value (LTV) 
In the context of recurring revenue, Lifetime Value (L TV) refers to the estimated 
total revenue a customer is expected to generate throughout their entire 
relationship with a company. L TV gives us an idea of the long-term value and 
proﬁtability of acquiring and retaining customers. L TV is a result of NRR.
In this case, the L TV of a $100,000 deal with an NRR of 1.10 over the lifetime of 5 
years can be calculated as follows:
ARR(Year 1): $100,000 
ARR(Year 2): $100,000 × 1.10 = $110,000
ARR(Year 3): $100,000 × 1.10 × 1.10 = $121,000
ARR(Year 4): $100,000 × 1.10 × 1.10 × 1.10 = $133,100
ARR(Year 5): $100,000 × 1.10 × 1.10 × 1.10 × 1.10 = $146,410
The compounding effect of NRR occurs year over year; this leads to exponential 
revenue growth. As the NRR improves, the nonlinearity of the curve becomes 
increasingly evident, and its disproportionate effect on growth becomes more 
pronounced. This can be observed in the next ﬁgure (Figure 7.10), where in year 
11, the growth rate (Δy) disproportionately grows, even though the increase in 
NRR from 1.1 to 1.15 to 1.2, and then to 1.25, is consistent. 
This explains an important yet often overlooked part of the hypergrowth engine, 
in layman's terms: The faster it goes, the more it accelerates—like a snowball 
rolling down a hill.

Acquisition and Expansion Operate in Two Different Domains
The 2020 movie Tenet mesmerized moviegoers with its mind-bending storyline. 
Directed by Christopher Nolan, known for his exploration of time in his ﬁlms, 
Tenet was his magnum opus. The movie operates across 2 different time 
domains: the ordinary and inverted worlds. In the ordinary world, time 
progresses forward in a linear fashion. However, in the inverted world, individuals 
and events can move backward in time. The coexistence of these 2 domains at 
the same time pushes us to think of time in 2 domains.
We are not using this example to teach you how to travel back in time, at least 
not yet. What this example does help us explain is that Tenet presents 2 
different, yet simultaneous, domains that appear similar but operate differently. 
Realizing that the movie unfolds in these 2 domains sets the stage for 
understanding that recurring revenue also functions, simultaneously, in 2 distinct 
domains, each governing growth differently (see Figure 7.11).
The nonlinearity of NRR leads to a disproportionate effect that becomes more 
pronounced at higher NRR rates. It is fundamental to driving hypergrowth.

The Acquisition Domain (left side of the Bowtie) and the Retention and 
Expansion Domain (right side of the Bowtie) are characterized by different 
factors, explaining why they operate differently:
● Open Loop vs. Closed Loop: The left side of the Bowtie currently 
operates as an open-loop system in which the output, measured in 
committed customers, is not used as an input. Consequently, the system 
does not self-correct based on the output it produces. As such, the loop 
must be manually closed by a customer-facing representative. The system 
must be corrected by, for instance, identifying that the prospect came from 
an unsuitable market, and advising the Lead Generation team to seek leads 
elsewhere. Conversely, the right side of the Bowtie is currently designed as 
a closed-loop system. In this system, customer commitment, such as a 
renewal, induces self-correcting behavior. If a customer ceases renewing, the 
system automatically responds with decreased revenue. One of the 
signiﬁcant advancements anticipated in the next decade, made possible by 
AI,  is the development of interconnected closed-loop systems across the 
entire customer journey, involving all roles and functions (see Section 4.2).
● Units vs. Revenue: The left side of the Bowtie is measured in units, 
such as leads, opportunities, and deals won. In contrast, the right side 
of the Bowtie is measured in revenue, such as MRR, ARR, and L TV. The 
transition between these domains is achieved by multiplying the number of 
units by a revenue value, such as the annual contract value (ACV). It's worth 
noting that the left side sometimes is assigned a revenue value by 
multiplying the number of units with the average sales price, reﬂecting the 
amount of “pipeline” created.
● Frequency vs. Time: The left side of the Bowtie operates on frequency, 
representing the rate of occurrence of events like meetings or emails sent. 
On the other hand, the right side is measured in terms of time, representing 
the duration or progression of events, such as monthly or annual 
recurrences. Frequency and time are related through the inverse formula 
(Frequency = 1 / Time). This relationship creates the right side of the Bowtie 
as an inverse domain of the left side, with each side operating differently.

The characteristics of the frequency and time domains explained. FIGURE 7.12
● Attrition vs. Accumulation: Attrition is observed on the left side of 
the Bowtie, indicating a decrease or loss of units or opportunities as 
they progress through the stages. For example, a lead to opportunity 
conversion rate (CR2) of 10% signiﬁes attrition of 90%. In contrast, 
accumulation is seen on the right side, indicating the growth or addition of 
revenue. For instance, a net revenue retention rate of 1.08 resulting from an 
8% price increase demonstrates an accumulation of revenue. The key 
difference lies in the direction of change, with attrition associated with the 
left side and accumulation (expansion) with the right side.
● Faster vs. Longer: In the acquisition domain, speed is crucial, and 
processes are designed to accelerate progress. Time is measured in days 
or seconds (PLG), emphasizing faster outcomes. On the other hand, in the 
Retention and Expansion stages, longevity is desired. So, processes are 
tailored to maximize the duration of customer engagement. Time is 
measured in months or years, focusing on extending the customer 
relationship and maximizing lifetime value.
Before You Make Decisions: Know Which Domain You’re Operating In
Understanding the domain in which you operate is essential. Actions that may 
seem similar, such as hiring or ﬁring a person, can impact growth differently 
depending on the domain. For example, consider the decision to save $100,000 
in salaries by terminating either a sales manager (SM) or a customer

Success manager (CSM). The tendency might lean towards laying off the CSM. 
However, modeling the impact will likely demonstrate that laying off the CSM 
can have a far more signiﬁcant (negative) effect on revenue growth. This is 
because their role is to help a large group of customers achieve impact. As we 
have seen, when customers achieve impact, they are more likely to renew, 
expand their business, and remain customers for a longer period. This growth 
can itself exceed that of acquisition. Furthermore, as the growth compounds 
over time, and due to its nonlinearity, it can generate more proﬁt in the years 
to come.
The recurring revenue factory concept is built on these unique characteristics 
within the Acquisition and Retention/Expansion domains. Organizations must 
optimize their growth strategies and drive sustainable revenue generation by 
recognizing the distinctions and designing processes accordingly.
GROWTH FORMULA AND UNIT ECONOMICS
Many companies continue to use a top-down approach in developing their 
operational plans. In this method, an organization selects a revenue target that 
aligns with its corporate goals, such as doubling the previous year's revenue to 
meet speciﬁc valuation objectives. The organization then formulates an 
operational plan, specifying the required number of sellers and the investment in 
marketing campaigns necessary to drive sales.
Growth Formula is a Mathematical Depiction of a GTM Motion
Consider a more scientiﬁc approach: envisioning a subscription business as a 
recurring revenue factory. The primary goal of this factory is to produce revenue 
in a cost-eﬃcient way through multiple GTM motions. Each GTM motion 
operates like a production line in a factory. The GTM motion is governed by what 
we call the Growth Formula—a mathematical depiction of the production 
capacity. The Growth Formula demonstrates cause and effect, outlining which 
factors contribute to growth and the necessary dependencies for preparation.

Unit Economics are Shorthand for the Growth Formula
Unit economics act as shorthand for the outcomes derived from the Growth 
Formula. For example, unit economics can say it takes 100 leads to generate 
$10,000 in ARR that yields $100,000 in L TV over 5 years. The Growth Formula 
also helps to test scenarios, such as calculating the cost of revenue, thereby 
helping companies plan the resources needed to achieve speciﬁc targets. 
Analyzing trends in unit economics help identify issues or opportunities, such as 
the need to adjust pricing or focus on a speciﬁc customer segments. 
Creating a Growth Formula
To create a Growth Formula, it is essential ﬁrst to normalize all the relevant 
metrics. In the context of the growth from acquisition, this primarily involves 
normalizing the sales price. The sales price is calculated by multiplying the list 
price by (1 - discount). Once all the metrics are normalized, we can calculate 
the Growth Formula.
This example will focus on the Growth Formula for an inbound GTM motion 
from NewCo. NewCo converts inbound website traﬃc into leads by capturing 
their email addresses. These leads are then nurtured through a campaign until 
they reach a speciﬁc lead score. At this point, a salesperson initiates a 
conversation with them. If the conversation meets speciﬁc criteria, the 
opportunity becomes qualiﬁed. The qualiﬁed opportunity then goes through to 
the sales team.

Demonstrating Cause and Effect
We can develop a Growth Formula for the inbound GTM motion using these 
metrics. Speciﬁcally, when we have 928 visitors per month (the cause), it leads 
to $67,555 in ARR per month (the effect). In this particular case, the Growth 
Formula is normalized based on the number of visitors per month. However, 
we can also normalize it using factors such as $100,000 ARR or a single win.
Normalizing the Growth Formula on a single win reveals that it takes 253 visitors 
to generate 30 leads, which then convert into 5 opportunities, and 1 gets 
qualiﬁed out. The remaining 4 qualiﬁed opportunities convert at a win rate of 
26% and an average discount of 23%; this translates to $18,408 in ARR.

Recurring revenue operates as an interconnected system, which means 
that changes in one conversion rate can impact other conversion rates. 
For instance, if the number of leads decreases, the quality of leads may 
also decrease, resulting in downstream effects. To simulate this scenario, 
we can apply a 5% reduction in performance across all conversion metrics.

The system-wide impact of a 5% reduction in each conversion metric is 
signiﬁcant, decreasing the ARR from $18,408 to $10,759. The marginal changes in 
the system vs. the magnitude of the impact on revenue emphasizes the volatility 
of a recurring revenue system. This demonstrates the importance of the use of a 
Growth Formula to perform scenario analysis. Scenario Analysis is a critical part 
of a scientiﬁc approach to revenue growth. 
Scenario Analysis 1: Impact of Discount on Win Rate
Offering discounts is a common practice to encourage customer purchases. 
However, it's often assumed that not offering a discount could decrease the win 
rate. But is this assumption always valid? The critical question is whether the 
revenue lost due to a potentially lower win rate is greater than the revenue lost 
through discounts. In our next scenario analysis, we'll explore the impact of 
eliminating the discount. We'll calculate the adjustment in the win rate to 
compensate for the difference in revenue acquired.

By reducing the discount to 0%, the ARR(commit) increases to $24,000. The win 
rate can now be offset by calculating 23.3% × ($18,408/$24,000) = 19.94%. In 
other words, with the adjusted win rate of 19.94%, the Growth Formula still 
achieves the same revenue of $18,408. The conclusion is that if all other metrics 
remain constant, the organization will gain more ARR by eliminating the 
discount, as long as the win rate stays above 19.94%. When the volume of deals 
is measured in the hundreds of deals a year, it is unlikely that the average win 
rate across will decrease signiﬁcantly due to the removal of the discount. Still, it 
would be beneﬁcial to conduct a test in an isolated market segment to validate 
your scenario analysis.

Scenario Analysis 2: Calculating the Impact on Lifetime Value (LTV)
We will use the normalized Growth Formula from Table 7.5 to calculate the 
impact on the customer L TV over a 5-year horizon, based on an ARR commit of 
$18,408. This commitment experiences in the ﬁrst year a 98% retention rate and 
a 102% expansion rate based on an annual price increase. As shown in Table 7.6, 
this data now extends to the next year and serves as the new baseline. Retention 
and expansion rates vary annually, leading to a total L TV of $106,909 over a 
5-year period (L TV-5Y).

Table 7.6 clariﬁes that a business with a recurring revenue stream operates 
differently: proﬁts are deferred and are reliant on future revenues. You will 
notice that revenue generated in the ﬁrst year of $18,408 against $106,909 only 
represents 17% of the customer's lifetime value over a 5-year horizon. That 
means 83% of the revenue depends on the seller's performance, over 5 
years—speciﬁcally, their ability to deliver the recurring impact.
The Growth Formula Opens a Whole New World
If you've come this far, it becomes evident that we are only at the beginning of 
exploring a new realm where GTM motions function like software—enabling you 
to test hypotheses and make predictions. Now, you can calculate your Growth 
Formula for various market segments, industries, products, and regions. A 
Growth Formula provides a detailed understanding of how speciﬁc growth 
motions within the revenue factory affect overall performance and offers 
actionable insights for reﬁning your strategies to optimize growth within each 
motion.

COMBINING THE MATHEMATICAL & REVENUE MODELS
Let’s compare the lifetime value of a deal based on 3 different monetization 
strategies, combining the Mathematical Model with the Revenue Model (see 
Table 7.7). 
By year ﬁve, the annual subscription (Model 2) surpasses the upfront payment 
(Model 1), suggesting the latter is better for customers not retained beyond 4 
years. Yet, the annual subscription with a 10% increase (Model 3) boasts a 90% 
higher revenue than the one-time payment model over a 7-year period.

Plotting the 3 monetization strategies illustrates the non-linear growth impact of a 
subscription service with an annual 10% price increase.
FIGURE 7.13
To visualize the impact these 3 different monetization strategies, we will plot 
each as a function of L TV on the vertical y-axis and time in years (n) on the 
horizontal x-axis. Right away, you will notice the disproportionate impact of the 
subscription model as a result of the annual 10% increase. In particular in later 
years as the revenue starts to take off. This visualizes the power of this model 
(Model 3) and why so many companies have chosen to pursue this 
monetization strategy.
Use Case: Netﬂix's Revenue Models
As a subscriber to pay-TV subscription services like Disney+, Netﬂix, and Hulu, 
you may occasionally experience a price increase. However, these increases do 
not appear to be of exponential signiﬁcance, and the timing of these increases 
seems random. But is that truly the case? Figure 7.13 illustrates Netﬂix's 
introduction of various price packages and the implementation of price hikes at 
different intervals, starting in 2013 when their revenue reached $5 billion.

The data reveals Netﬂix's gradual price increases and package 
diversiﬁcation over time, with recent hikes showing a non-linear trend 
across all packages. It is worth noting that in 2022, Netﬂix introduced 
advertisements in the basic offering, thereby incorporating an additional 
monetization model for their business.
It demonstrates the signiﬁcance of timing and how it can have a 
disproportionate, exponential impact when combined with a slight price 
increase.

Run scenarios based on the Growth Formula to learn how the business scales. 
Carefully evaluate the results of the different scenarios, as they will provide 
insights into how your business scales. "Scalability" refers to how the system 
responds to various adjustments. Here are a few scenarios to consider:
● Apply a 10% increase to each conversion metric (VM1 and CR1 to CR5) 
and assess the impact on ARRSTART and L TV. Remember to normalize 
the discount ﬁrst. For example, if you are offering a 20% discount, a 10% 
improvement on the discount would be 18%. Normalizing this means 
that CR5 changes from 0.8 to 0.82.
● Explore changes to the NRR with increments of 5%, and observe the impact. 
Don't forget to decrease the NRR by 5% increments as well.
● Extend the length of the L TV from 5 to 6 to 7 years, and analyze the effects. 
Conversely, shorten the L TV to 4 years and then to 3 years.
It's important to note that while scalability focuses on the system's response, 
sustainability takes costs into account. In Chapter 10, we will discuss the GTM 
model and its relationship to the costs associated with scalability.
Establish a scalability thesis. 
Based on this, you may have gained a good idea of how to drive short- and 
long-term revenue growth. Now, let's establish the top 3 metrics that your 
company needs to focus on based on scalability:

RECAP OF THE MATHEMATICAL MODEL
The Mathematical Model in recurring revenue business reveals 2 different 
growth engines that map to each side of the Bowtie Data model.
On the left side, Revenue Acquisition is characterized by a process of attrition 
and is subject to a compound effect, marked by repeated multiplication across 
multiple conversion points. The absence of a feedback loop accentuates this 
effect, making Acquisition highly sensitive to even the smallest changes. When 
these changes occur simultaneously across various parts of the customer 
journey, they signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the outcome—this can lead to either 
accelerated growth or an unexpected crash.

The simpliﬁed Mathematical Model shows that both acquisition and expansion are based

FIGURE 7.15
∑
The right side of the model, focusing on revenue from Retention and Expansion, 
is more complex. It involves both processes for attrition (GRR) and accumulation 
(NRR). They are driven by a feedback loop, which fuels exponential growth and 
creates more stability than the left side. Here, positive actions, such as 
widespread adoption or effective upselling, don't just add value in isolation. 
Instead, they feed back into the system, amplifying subsequent actions in a 
virtuous cycle.

C H A P T E R   0 7   |   M A T H E M A T I C A L   M O D E L
This makes the right side of the Bowtie responsive to positive changes. Minor 
improvements in product quality or engagement strategies can lead to 
disproportionately large gains in recurring revenue. This is the realm of 
exponential growth, where tweaks and enhancements can propel a business into 
hypergrowth, leveraging the foundation laid in the acquisition phase.
Breaking Down Silos: The Key to Unlocking Nonlinear Potential
What the Mathematical Model demonstrates is that everything is connected, and 
everything impacts each other. It means that overcoming the silo mentality is 
crucial to unlocking the full potential of nonlinear recurring revenue systems. 
Substantial and sustained revenue growth is achieved by consistently making 
iterative improvements throughout the customer journey, especially during the 
Retention and Expansion phases. Executives who fail to grasp nonlinearity and 
continue to operate in silos will impede growth.
Volatility: The Double-Edged Sword of Nonlinearity
The SaaS crash in 2022 was a stark reminder of the system's volatility. The 
recurring revenue systems worked in reverse; marginal declines across the 
customer journey led to a steep decline in growth. Understanding this reversal is 
crucial for future decision-making and managing nonlinear systems effectively.
The Key to Hypergrowth: Embracing Nonlinearity across the Leadership Team
Modern revenue leaders must embrace the mathematics of nonlinearity 
explained in this chapter. It is crucial to adopt a data-driven mentality and 
implement continuous improvement processes across all aspects of the 
business. This approach drives hypergrowth in revenue acquisition, retention, 
and expansion, steering organizations toward accelerated growth and long-term 
success.

In Part II, we delved deep into the 3 foundational models that are essential for 
designing a revenue factory: the Revenue Model, the Data Model, and the 
Mathematical Model. The Revenue Model builds on the foundation of the First 
Principles from Part I, deﬁning the why and how of your revenue streams with 
unique operational metrics and risk proﬁles for each monetization strategy.  The 
Data Model, purpose-built for recurring revenue organizations, transforms the 
classic marketing and sales funnel into a comprehensive Data Model shaped like 
a Bowtie. It captures the entire customer lifecycle from acquisition to long-term 
engagement. This model emphasizes customer impact at every stage of the 
customer journey.
However, the true beauty of the recurring revenue engine is unveiled through the 
Mathematical Model. This model introduces nonlinear dynamics, illustrating how 
small changes can lead to disproportionate outcomes. Such dynamics not only 
power the engine but also reveal its sensitivity to these small changes, 
emphasizing the importance of understanding how the system operates to 
prevent it from crashing.
Part II focused on designing a sophisticated recurring revenue system tailored to 
the subtleties of exponential growth and customer engagement. The goal of this 
section has extended beyond merely achieving growth; it is really to gain a deep 
understanding of how recurring revenue growth works. This knowledge allows 
us to roll up our sleeves and start building your recurring revenue factory. For 
this we are going to rely on the next 3 models: the Operating Model, the Growth 
Model, and the GTM Model.

In previous sections, we laid the groundwork for understanding growth 
through recurring revenue, focusing on its 3 components: acquisition, retention, 
and expansion. We highlighted the crucial role of impact in each of these areas 
as a prerequisite for meaningful growth. To capture recurring Impact 
comprehensively, we evolved the classic marketing and sales funnel into a 
Bowtie model that includes customer success. This adjustment allows us to 
identify the key stages where such impact occurs.

Building on this, we explored growth mathematics, discovering that acquisition, 
retention, and expansion typically follow polynomial or exponential trajectories. 
This reveals the disproportionate effects a small change can have on outcomes. 
Equipped with this insight, we crunched the numbers for the recurring revenue 
system across the customer journey, culminating in a Growth Formula. This 
formula provides valuable unit economics and informs our decision-making 
process.
Up next, we'll focus on day-to-day operations, using 3 additional models 
that build upon the foundational frameworks: the Operating Model, the Growth 
Model, and ﬁnishing off with the GTM Model.

In subscription- and consumption-based businesses, critical functions like      
lead generation, sales, onboarding, retention, and expansion often operate in 
compartmentalized silos. This siloed structure commonly leads to inter- 
department interoperability issues. As revenue increases, each silo tends           
to develop into a ﬁefdom, further entrenching its unique methods and  
deepening investment in specialized tools. Initially, startups beneﬁt from 
operating free from the constraints of overarching uniﬁed systems and 
standardized processes. However, they soon face considerable challenges  
as they introduce new GTM motions for penetrating different markets, 
launching additional products, or expanding into new regions.
This scenario resembles a factory metaphor. Growth necessitates the 
introduction of new GTM motions, similar to launching multiple production lines. 
The ramp-up of existing production and the initiation of new lines create issues, 
especially when utilizing the same machinery and personnel. It soon leads to 
chaos in the revenue factory, as machinery is misapplied across different lines 
and employees grapple with unclear roles across various stations.
This chaos manifests in the company's ﬁnancials, evidenced by growth stalling, 
costs escalating, and dwindling productivity. The situation worsens as revenue 
increases. SaaS companies are not the ﬁrst ones to run into this, and they can 
draw valuable insights from traditional factories, which encountered similar 
challenges in their formative years.

The concept of a factory guides us toward an Operating Model—a strategic 
framework that factories employ to structure and manage their production 
processes, systems, and resources. In this chapter, we will develop an 
Operating Model, described in the next 3 sections:
● The Incompatibility of Means and Methods (8.1)
● Creating a Customer Centric Methodology (8.2)
● Interface All Means and Methods Across the Customer Journey (8.3)
Let's begin by understanding the cause of the problem.
INCOMPATIBILITY OF MEANS AND METHODS
Revenue operators face a signiﬁcant challenge: the widespread use of 
incompatible means and myriad methods across GTM teams. Eliminating 
many of these tools and methods might seem tempting, but it is not feasible; 
instead, the priority should be to create Interoperability. Next, we delve into what 
Interoperability in GTM entails, focusing on the following aspects:
● The Use of Different Means and Methods (8.1.1)
● The Complexity of Interfacing Different Means and Methods (8.1.2)
● Creating Interoperability (8.1.3)
Let’s start our exploration with a fundamental question: how did we end up with 
so many means and methods in the ﬁrst place?
The Use of Different Means and Methods
A venture-backed startup often comprises a small group of experts in their 
respective ﬁelds, each with years, sometimes decades, of experience. As a 
relatively small team, they can make quick decisions. In these early days, the 
startup often achieves high velocity due to a lack of formal processes. 
However, when a startup reaches a couple of million in revenue, it experiences 
a growth spurt, often expanding from around 10 people to 100 in a year.

This rapid expansion is where problems begin to surface. Each new hire joins 
a company that lacks established processes for recruiting, onboarding, and all 
operational aspects of their job. 
As they take on their responsibilities, they quickly notice the absence of these 
deﬁned means and methods needed to perform their roles. Consequently, 
they tend to introduce the practices and methodologies they gained from their 
previous jobs. And so, as the company grows, the number of incompatible 
means and methods grows. 
At this stage, several complications arise that signiﬁcantly decrease the 
eﬃciency and effectiveness of the GTM operation, deeply rooting themselves 
within the organization.
● The proliferation of incompatible methodologies within a function: 
Organizations often let teams pick their own means and methods, not 
realizing the damage they are causing. For example, teams across 
regions, products, or market segments may adopt their own means and 
methods. In sales, for example, you might ﬁnd the use of BANT in one 
geographical area or segment and MEDDIC in another. 
● Most tool vendors promote a unique approach: Each vendor believes they 
are here to change the world, often introducing new vocabulary, means, and 
methods into the customer process. They seek to differentiate themselves 
from the competition through their own terminology. As a result, with dozens 
of tools come dozens of approaches and acronyms.
● Executives inﬂuence the system and then depart: Executives joining 
growing companies usually have the freedom to choose their preferred 
means and methods, particularly early on. They create new processes, 
add tools, and bring on personnel from their previous roles. In fast- 
growing companies, executive tenure averages about 18 months. It means 
that by the time a company reaches $50M in ARR, typically around its 
eighth year, it has cycled through several executives in various roles, each 
contributing to the patchwork of means and methods.

## Page 240

C H A P T E R   0 8   |   O P E R A T I N G   M O D E L
● Consulting ﬁrms take advantage of the chaos: Independent consulting 
ﬁrms are hired to integrate parts such as Sales or Marketing. They 
cross-train teams, integrate tool stacks, etc. Everyone involved in this 
process, particularly those with ﬁnancial interests, beneﬁts from the 
chaos—the newly hired executive who can lead with a new approach, the 
consulting ﬁrm, the tool vendor, and the speakers at conferences who, in 
20-minute speaking slots, talk about the "next big thing."
These points highlight organizations' complexities and challenges, particularly in 
GTM operations. The ﬁgure below illustrates the outcomes of these challenges: 
departments operating independently, which leads to ineﬃciencies and a 
disjointed customer experience—impacting the eﬃciency but hampering the 
effectiveness of achieving recurring impact.
Departments operate independently, leading to ineﬃciencies. This disjointed approach 
makes it challenging for customers to experience consistent, recurring impact.

The Complexity of Interfacing Different Means and Methods
Let’s explore how the increase in non-interoperable means and methods leads 
to an explosion in interconnections and an exponential rise in complexity. It 
causes costs to escalate, productivity to drop, and the growth rate to decline. 
We are going to illustrate this point by starting with a high touch GTM motion 
and adding a low touch GTM motion.

Case in point: Account-based marketing (ABM) is a methodology that assists 
marketers in targeting the right customers through a method known as an 
Ideal Customer Proﬁle (ICP). The ICP is crafted based on personas within an 
account, employing a method known as a “buying center.” It identiﬁes key 
roles such  as Decider and Inﬂuencer, enabling marketers to create 
messaging that is speciﬁcally tailored for each role. This method of 
messaging is called nurturing, which develops sales opportunities over time. 
Subsequently, the Enterprise sales team employs a deal qualiﬁcation method 
called MEDDIC to develop the opportunities into a mutual commitment.
The above high touch GTM motion evolves into a series of interconnected 
means and methods. To generate millions in revenue using a high-velocity 
GTM motion, it must operate like a well-oiled production line in a factory, 
requiring seamless integration. While this seems simple at ﬁrst, the reality is 
far from it. The means and methods employed are implemented by various 
departments, each with its own goals, specialized tools, different metrics, 
and speaking in unintelligible dialects.

But it gets worse. Let's look at what happens when we add a new GTM motion 
in the form of a low touch GTM motion: SEO, Content, Inbound, and Nurturing 
are added as means while a different method is launched in BANT.

Complexity Escalates Cost, Lowers Productivity, and Causes Growth to Decline
Consider that most organizations operate 2 to 3 GTM motions at $30M in 
revenue, but at $150M in revenue this has grown to as many as a dozen, 
creating a disarray between departments, functions, and regions. Imagine a 
business having to respond, rapidly, to changing market conditions. Content 
must be redeveloped, and new SEO terms must be created based on the latest 
messaging. Personnel will require retraining, while processes and playbooks 
require a refresh—essentially, a virtual overhaul of all functions. Without an 
architected approach, these adaptations lead to disproportionately high costs, 
a declining productivity per rep, and a drop in revenue growth. 
The root cause of the GTM issue is that the number of interconnections between 
various means and methods increases exponentially with each additional GTM motions, 
this causes cost to escalate and productivity to decline.

Creating Interoperability
Interoperability across various means and methods throughout the customer 
journey is essential for subscription or consumption-based businesses. It 
ensures a consistent customer experience, crucial for building trust and 
satisfaction. By streamlining operations, Interoperability leads to more eﬃcient 
and productive transitions throughout the customer journey. It, in turn, promotes 
renewals, enhances upselling opportunities, and fosters customer advocacy. 
Additionally, Interoperability plays a vital role in promoting collaboration among 
personnel, signiﬁcantly impacting expense management in these organizations. 
As a result, Interoperability becomes a competitive differentiator for a recurring 
revenue business.
Use-Case: Interoperability in the Mobile Phone Industry
In the late 1990s, Nokia and Ericsson dominated the mobile phone industry, 
frequently releasing new models. However, the variety of these models led to 
compatibility issues with new, complex applications. In contrast, Apple and 
Google rose to prominence by adopting standardized approaches with their iOS 
and Android operating systems. This standardization enabled seamless app 
launches on their platforms, revolutionizing the industry. As a result, Nokia and 
Ericsson struggled to keep pace with innovation, leading to a decline in market 
share and consumer loyalty. Apple’s and Google's strategies led to millions of 
Apps, reshaping the mobile phone industry.

Operating Models Are Crucial to Achieve Market Dominance
Today, an Operating System is a foundational platform in the software world, 
managing various applications and resources. In the business realm, this is 
mirrored by an Operating Model. Market leaders have leveraged the power of an 
Operating Model for their success. For instance, Amazon transformed cloud 
computing and data management with its Amazon Web Services (AWS). 
Salesforce reshaped the CRM space through its AppExchange, creating a robust 
ecosystem for business applications. The same is true for Adobe with its 
Creative Cloud suite. These examples show that many market leaders employ an 
Operating Model to maintain their competitive edge. This leads to a question: 
Can an Operating Model be effectively used internally to structure and manage a 
company's GTM resources to achieve its business objectives?
The Three Components of a Uniform Customer-Centric Methodology
By drawing parallels between the concepts of an Operating Model and System, 
we can formulate a strategic framework that consists of 3 components:
1. The System for which we have the Bowtie model (see Chapter 4).
2. The Apps are represented by the Means and Methods used in GTM.
3. But what about a Standardized Interface akin to the role of an API in 
Software? How do we recreate that in an Operating Model?
That is what we are going to do next. We will demonstrate how to develop a 
standardized interface that facilitates interoperability among the myriad of 
means and methods used in various GTM motions, integrating them into the 
Bowtie as the central system.

A CUSTOMER-CENTRIC METHODOLOGY
The cornerstone of recurring revenue lies in delivering consistent Impact. When 
customers experience signiﬁcant, positive impacts, they tend to renew and 
expand their commitments, boosting recurring revenue. It demonstrates that 
Impact is integral to every revenue discussion. But what exactly is Impact? How 
can it be identiﬁed, and what actions should be taken upon recognizing it?
In this chapter, we'll delve into the essence of Impact, examining its origins and 
inﬂuence on economic decisions in the following sections:
● Impact: Everything you need to know about Impact (8.2.1).
● Situation and Pain: The drivers behind Impact (8.2.2).
● Critical Event: Impact in the context of time (8.2.3).
● Decision: How a customers' decisions are inﬂuenced by Impact (8.2.4).
By putting Situation, Pain, Impact, Critical Events, and Decision together we get:
● SPICED: A standardized approach for recurring revenue (8.2.5)
SPICED operates as a standard interface enabling various methods and means 
to interact seamlessly. It fosters a common language across departments, 
enhancing collaboration and easing role transitions. The standardization breaks 
down barriers between functions caused by incompatible means and methods. 
All of this is centered on Impact, so let's roll up our sleeves and dive right in.
 IMPACT CRITICAL EVENT DECISION PAIN SITUATION
An existing situation 
leads to a pain point 
(or presents a large 
opportunity).
This highlights 
the necessity for 
change or Impact.
The Impact is needed 
by an upcoming event 
which creates a sense 
of urgency.
A  decision must be 
made to attain Impact 
before a critical event 
occurs.

Everything You Need to Know About Impact
Impact refers to the tangible result that your product or service brings to a 
customer. The industry has embraced consultative selling over the past decade 
and transitioned from selling features and beneﬁts to selling solutions. However, 
to truly excel, we must move beyond solutions and focus on delivering Impact.
Consider an example: ACME offers an exceptional product that consolidates 
email, social media, and text messages into a single inbox, in real time. The 
solution is the consolidation of a myriad of communication systems, and one   
of the Impacts is the time saved. In this, Impact represents what users gain from 
using the product; it must matter to them. Offering an Impact that does  not 
resonate with the customer will not result in recurring revenue. 
The 2 most prevalent forms of Impact are:
● Increase Revenue: Companies prioritize business growth and value 
enhancement, making revenue growth a paramount objective. Products 
that contribute to revenue growth often experience shorter sales cycles 
and can be sold at higher prices.
● Reduce Cost: Solutions focusing on cost reduction appeal to decision- 
makers due to their eﬃciency-driven value proposition. Opting for a cost- 
reducing solution may seem straightforward, but these solutions can face 
price competition and make the business reliant on deal volume.

The Discovery of a New Kind of Impact: Emotional Impact
The forms of Impact depicted in the previous ﬁgure are quantiﬁable. They 
can be measured. These are referred to as Rational Impact. However, there is 
another Impact dimension of Impact to consider: saving time. 
This is where things start to get interesting. Imagine selling a product that, 
when used effectively, can save 10% of the time spent across multiple teams. It 
indicates an opportunity for either increasing revenue by utilizing the saved 
time to sell more or maintaining the same revenue at a lower cost by reducing 
the headcount. Clearly, saving time generates rational impact.
But what if these time savings not only beneﬁt the company but they extend to 
the users of the product? What if employees can now perform their job more 
eﬃciently, allowing them to leave early on a Friday afternoon and spend time 
with their loved ones? What if they no longer have to work the entire weekend 
manually compiling data because this new magical tool handles it effortlessly? 
These scenarios point to another beneﬁt, but this beneﬁt goes to the user, not 
the company. You recognize it when using a product that is so simple to use that 
it just makes you happy. It makes you want to work with the product more often. 
Think of some of the apps on your phone; some are so easy and fantastic to use, 
whereas others are highly complex with many features that cause continuous 
frustration. This happy feeling you have when working with a product outlines 
the key to emotional impact.

Three Principles that Govern Emotional Impact
There are 3 principles that will tell us all we need to know about Emotional 
Impact and that shape the process of how decisions are made:
Emotional Impact First Beneﬁts a Person, then the Company
Emotional impact ﬁrst beneﬁts the person, which increases productivity and 
improves retention, whereas rational impact ﬁrst beneﬁts a company and then 
beneﬁts the person. For example, when your product saves the buyer $1M, the 
money isn’t going to the person ﬁrst. At least, I hope not. Once it gets to the 
company, they may return some of it to the employee in the form of a bonus. 
However, if your product is simple to use, that beneﬁts the person directly. Over 
the past few years, we have seen this put into practice as users now play a 
deciding role when purchasing a product, as managers know that adoption will 
not happen otherwise.
A ubiquitous form of emotional impact is an improved user experience, which 
can be due to a simpliﬁed user interface. Enhancing customer interactions 
and experiences leads to productivity improvements and is often perceived  
as a cost-reduction solution. This points to a major challenge, in that different 
users are likely to experience the product differently. It leads us to the next 
principle. 
Emotional Impact Varies by Person
Each person experiences emotional impact differently. Rational impact, on 
the other hand, is often similar across all those involved in the decision: make 
more money or lower cost. Figure 8.9 shows a series of meetings conducted 
over a period, mapped to a 5-stage sales process. The rational impact stays 
consistent over time, invariably involving some form of ROI, which is based 
on a combination of revenue increase and cost reduction. Now compare this 
to the emotional impact on the right. As the opportunity progresses, more 
people join the process, each with their own take, and their own needs. And 
most of these people will not voice those takes as they may involve internal 
politics.

Humans Make Emotional Decisions
Humans tend to make an emotional decision and then justify the decisions 
with facts and ﬁgures. This understanding highlights the signiﬁcance of 
product demonstrations, which can make an emotional impact, as they 
demonstrate how easy a product is to use. This makes the buyer want it for the 
beneﬁts it offers to them.
This additional dimension of emotional impact, in addition to rational impact 
helps us understand the difference between an independent user buying an 
application, and a group of decision-makers in an enterprise buying a platform.

Use Case: Emotional vs. Rational Impact
Let's explore how emotional decisions inﬂuence the decision-making process. 
Within a customer's organization, we identify 2 distinct roles: the Champion, who 
sees your solution in action (e.g., during a product demo), and the Decider, 
tasked with addressing a speciﬁc problem or opportunity. Both the Champion 
and the Decider assess your product's rational impact in either solving a problem 
or seizing an opportunity. The main difference between a Champion and a 
Decider is that the Decider has the authority to allocate resources to achieve the 
desired impact within a speciﬁc timeframe. Simply put, a Decider has a deadline 
and a deliverable, while a Champion has neither.
Within this dynamic the seller's role is now twofold: ﬁrst, to uncover the 
Decider's rational impact by addressing the Champion's emotional impact, and 
second, to enable the Champion to sell the rational impact to the Decider(s) 
internally, so the Decider wants to learn more (referred to as a curiosity gap).
Let's explore how a seller can achieve this through 4 key moments in 
communication, and how both rational and emotional impact inﬂuence the 
decision-making process.
● Moment 1: During a discovery call, the seller combines question-based 
techniques with a product demonstration to uncover the company's rational 
needs and the Champion's desired emotional Impact. The seller actively 
listens for the emotive language used by the Champion, such as "Creating 
the dashboards every week is giving me a headache." 
This insight lets the sales professional empathize with the Champion 
and demonstrate how the product leverages AI to generate customized 
dashboards. By addressing the Champion’s needs, the seller builds trust 
and identiﬁes what the Champion’s boss, the Decider, seeks: “The 
dashboards are important to you; what is important to your CRO?” 
In this example, the Champion responds, "Our chief revenue oﬃcer is on 
the hook to increase revenue within the next 90 days."
250

## Page 251

C H A P T E R   0 8   |   O P E R A T I N G   M O D E L
● Moment 2: During the follow-up, the sales professional can use the discovered 
rational needs, stating, "Based on the data you provided, we can help your CRO 
increase revenue by approximately $200,000 in the next 90 days." 
● Moment 3: In the subsequent discovery call, the Champion is asked to 
ensure alignment on the speciﬁc rational impact desired by the CRO. In this 
case, provide the additional revenue within 90 days and ensure the most 
relevant data are available to demonstrate how the product can help 
achieve the desired impact.
● Moment 4: During the follow-up on-site meeting with a small group of 
stakeholders, the discussion begins with reviewing their needs and 
demonstrating how the product can help the Decider achieve the desired 
impact within 90 days. A closed-ended question such as "Is this what you 
were looking for?" can be used to transition into exploring the impact on 
their business. As evident, anchoring on the right rational impact that your 
product can deliver and aligning it with the emotional impact desired by the 
Decider is paramount.
These 4 moments demonstrate the key role that emotional impact plays, and 
highlights the need for enablement of the internal buying process. 
The goal is to prevent a situation where an internal Champion approaches 
the Decider and convinces them to buy the product based solely on its 
emotional Impact. For example, it has “fantastic looking dashboards.” 
Instead, it is the role of the sales professionals to arm the Champion with 
guidance and materials that effectively convey the rational Impact that is 
important to the Decider. For example, they could focus on how to increase 
revenue in 90 days. This can be as straightforward as a brief write-up 
accompanied by a recorded demo or a supporting calculation.

The Stickiness of Emotional Impact
While rational impact is crucial for driving customer commitment, it's equally 
essential to recognize the power of emotional impact in fostering long-term 
loyalty. Customers quickly become accustomed to rational impact and may 
overlook the original ROI that initially drove their commitment. For instance, 
consider an initial sales pitch where your ROI model was based on your 
solution costing $60,000 annually, consolidating 2 products that together cost 
$100,000 annually, thus resulting in yearly savings of $40,000. 
While this ROI may be impressive initially, its relevance tends to diminish after 
the ﬁrst year. As time passes, the buyer is likely to forget about the individual 
products and their associated costs, focusing solely on your software solution's 
$60,000 annual price tag. In other words, they become desensitized to the 
rational impact. This shift in perspective can be felt in conversations around 
the renewal.
Now, let's consider the emotional impact of that same product. Perhaps it 
offers simplicity, boasts stunning visuals, and has garnered a devoted user 
base. The users are likely to revolt if a newly hired CRO decides to shift away 
from your product. 
This scenario is more common than you might think. Why? Because emotional 
impact adheres to the laws of habit formation. The longer users enjoy your 
product and develop ingrained habits, the more challenging it becomes to 
break those habits and switch to an alternative. This can increase resistance 
and potential turnover, putting long-term relationships at risk. While customers 
may have initially purchased your product based on its rational impact, the 
emotional impact makes it stick and fosters ongoing loyalty.

Impact Is the One Constant Across the Customer Journey
As emphasized throughout this book, a subscription-based business, or any 
business for that matter, must center all of its GTM efforts and organizational 
structure around consistently delivering recurring impact to the customer. This 
Impact-centric approach shapes the customer journey, with the pivotal moment 
of achieving recurring Impact as its anchor, from which the journey cascades 
upstream and downstream. In contrast, a prospect/lead-based journey follows a 
cascading path from the top of the sales funnel to a win. This should tell you that 
if you want to create a common language, it should be based on Impact, and if 
you want to be based on a uniform methodology, it needs to be centered around 
Impact.

Situation and Pain as Drivers Behind Impact
In sales, the ability to uncover Impact is a crucial factor that can make or break 
a deal. It requires sellers to delve deeper into the customer's world, understand 
their desired consequences, and align their product or service to deliver the 
desired Impact. The results of a study conducted by Winning by Design during 
the ﬁrst half of 2023 of over 50,000 sales opportunities found that reps who 
adeptly uncovered Impact during discovery calls and effectively positioned their 
offerings against the customers' Impact sold, on average, 53% more against the 
same amount of opportunities. This underscores the importance of uncovering 
Impact. To illustrate this concept let’s consider solution selling (see Figure 8.11).
In this approach, a product is pitched following an initial diagnosis. It starts with 
a Conversation, gradually increasing customer engagement through thoughtful 
Situational and Pain questions. This is followed by a Pitch, an effective pitch 
boosts customer engagement, while a lengthy or irrelevant one sees the client 
tune out. It's important to avoid overwhelming the customer with too many 
situational questions. Instead, GTM reps should strive for a balanced approach, 
combining their research with 2 to 3 Situational questions leading to 1 or 2 
relevant Pain questions. It is common for Solution selling to pitch several 
features and beneﬁts that the solutions offer.

What we are going to do is insert a summary before pitching (see Figure 8.12). It 
requires the GTM rep to take careful notes during the diagnosis and ask for 
conﬁrmation after presenting the summary. The customer will either conﬁrm the 
accuracy with a response like, “You got it right,” or they will provide more details. 
Again, a recap should follow this. It's critical for a GTM rep to ensure alignment 
with the customer, creating a platform that offers 3 options:
● Reset the Conversation: If the GTM rep's summary does not align with the 
customer's perspective, or if the conversation veers off course, the GTM rep 
can reset the diagnose by asking new situational and pain questions.
● Pitch or Demo: Some customers, eager for concrete details, may prefer a 
straightforward pitch, better yet a demonstration of the product. This can 
include features and beneﬁts that set a solution apart. When executed well, 
this can offer remarkable clarity and increase the deal velocity.
● Uncover the Recurring Impact: Lastly, the summary can act as a 
springboard for identifying Recurring Impact. This shifts the conversation 
from a solution-based approach to a consultative-based approach.
Recognizing the signiﬁcance of Impact, we will explore how to uncover the 
recurring impact a client seeks, escalating to a consultative approach. These 
skills are not only crucial during client Acquisition, but equally important across 
the entire customer journey, in particular during Retention and Expansion.

A common mistake among untrained GTM reps is diagnosing problems solely 
against their product's capabilities, leaving customers feeling pressured into a 
sale. To avoid this happens, GTM reps should emphasize preparation, active 
listening, and diligent note-taking. These practices are key to summarizing the 
customer's objectives accurately, and pinpointing the speciﬁc (Recurring) Impact 
the client seeks.
Uncovering Recurring Impact
After establishing a platform through effective discovery, elevate the 
conversation in 3 simple steps to uncover the Impact (see Figure 8.12):
● Step 1. Empathize
● Step 2. Share a relevant story
● Step 3. Uncover Impact
Empathizing with the customer's situation, sharing a relevant story, and 
showcasing the impact achieved by others helps build trust. This approach 
develops trust, you have seen this before, and enables you to understand and 
explore the speciﬁc Impact the customer seeks.

EMPATHIZE
Empathy signals that you have been there before building trust. Think of a 
scenario where you asked a waiter for advice on what wine to drink:
● Group: “Most guests enjoy a white wine with the halibut.”
● Expert: “The chef recommends a white wine with the halibut.”
● Personal: “I had that earlier today, and I really enjoyed a white wine with it.”
Each of these invokes a sense of empathy for the decision you are about to 
make, developing a sense of trust that comes from having been in this situation 
before.
SHARE A RELEVANT STORY
In the framework of uncovering the Impact, you see that "story" is depicted in a 
key area with the intent to help establish Impact. Here is how this works: every 
great story follows one of the few well-deﬁned frameworks for stories. In the 
world of storytelling, it is not called a framework but an arc. In this case, we 
follow the arc of a story called "Man in the Hole" by Kurt Vonnegut.

This story's arc allows us to explain a customer's challenges and describe the 
negative Impact they experienced (the falling) as if they kept digging the hole 
deeper and deeper by not taking action. Once they took action, they got out of 
the hole and experienced a positive Impact. For this to work, we will lay the 
SPICED framework on top of it, which takes the customer down the rollercoaster 
of emotions before getting to the resolution. 
● Part 1: The Situation makes it relevant to them.
● Part 2: Not just the Pain but particularly the description of the negative 
Impact of not solving the problem (no action), or solving it incorrectly. 
● Part 3: Present the positive Impact the solution has had on the person 
(emotional) and the company (rational).
The lows are intended to make the highs feel higher, which, according to 
Vonnegut, make a story more memorable. Using SPICED, the marketing team 
can now use the Man in the Hole arc to codify their stories so all GTM reps can 
more easily share them.
The ﬁlm Rocky is a classic example of the Man in the Hole narrative. 
● Part 1 (S). Sylvester Stallone stars as Rocky Balboa, a debt-collecting 
boxer whose passion for the sport doesn't match his unfulﬁlled life. 
● Part 2 (P). When he faces Apollo Creed, Rocky is outmatched but 
undeterred, enduring a punishing bout that brings him to his lowest point. 
● Part 3 (I). Despite not clinching victory, Rocky's unwavering spirit earns 
him respect and admiration, transforming him into an icon of resilience 
and hope. 
His ascent from hardship to the brink of success epitomizes the inspiring 
power of perseverance inherent in the Man in the Hole narrative.

STEP 3. UNCOVER IMPACT
Imagine ﬁnding a gold coin on the beach. You'd likely pick it up, examine it, 
and consider yourself lucky. But the real opportunity lies in grabbing a shovel and 
starting to dig. 
Many sales professionals stop asking questions once they've identiﬁed a client's 
pain, instinctively mapping it to their solution and beginning their pitch. However, 
identifying a client's pain is merely scratching the surface. The real 
treasure—Impact—is often buried deep, but how do we get to it?
To uncover Impact is like peeling back layers of an onion, one at a time.FIGURE 8.15

Peeling the Onion One Layer at a Time 
Think of Impact as the core of an onion, encased by superﬁcial layers that 
represent a customer's Situation and Pain. Your task is to peel these layers 
back, one by one. Use the insights gained from each layer to inform your next 
question, continually digging deeper until you reach the Impact.

## Page 260

C H A P T E R   0 8   |   O P E R A T I N G   M O D E L
It's a journey, so be patient; unearthing all the Impact goals your client may have 
could take between 3 and 7 questions. This is referred to as question based 
sales techniques, the most notable one is referred to as SPIN Selling™. 
You might wonder, why not just ask directly? Counterintuitively, this approach 
risks backﬁring. The customer might give you an answer, but it could mislead 
you. Worse, they might get annoyed at having to articulate their thoughts. More 
importantly, this layer-by-layer approach not only helps you discover the true 
Impact but also gives you a deeper understanding of the driving forces behind a 
client’s decision-making.
Structure of a Discovery Sequence
The key to success lies in your expertise and using your customer's own 
words to frame your questions. Here's a basic formula to structure your 
discovery sequence:
1. Start with 2 to 3 situational questions, drawing on prior research 
or context provided earlier in the conversation. Overdo it, and the 
customer may feel interrogated.
2. Follow up with 1 or 2 pain questions. If the customer starts to vent, 
take notes and ask them to prioritize their issues. Be mindful of body 
language and avoid harping on the pain, as it can make the interaction 
uncomfortably intense.
3. Conclude with a few pointed Impact questions. 
Here are a few examples that can help you uncover impact once you have 
established empathy:
● What Impact does solving the problem have on your team?
● What effect will that have on customer satisfaction?
● What happened the last time a big challenge wasn't addressed in time?
● How important is solving this issue to you?
Now that we’ve delved into how to uncover the Impact, our next stop is 
understanding how this Impact evolves over time.

IMPACT
Critical Event
A Critical Event is a speciﬁc deadline or milestone within the client’s journey that 
signiﬁcantly impacts their decision-making process. It is a time-sensitive event 
or circumstance that creates a sense of urgency for the client to take action. The 
Critical Event can vary depending on the nature of the business and the speciﬁc 
situation. Still, it often involves a pressing need for Impact, a problem that 
requires immediate attention, or an opportunity that must be seized within a 
deﬁned timeframe.
A Critical Event serves as a catalyst for the customer to decide whether to 
implement a solution, renew a contract, or expand their engagement. Not 
conﬁned to a speciﬁc date, it can also be a ﬂexible milestone, like the end of a 
funding round or reaching a user milestone such as surpassing a million users.
To identify a Critical Event, one should determine its impact by asking, "When   do 
you need this by?" and follow up with "What happens if you miss that date?"   If 
there's hesitation from the customer, the urgency of the event may not be as 
critical. The presence of a Critical Event indicates the customer's prioritization of 
the problem/opportunity. This also points to there being a relationship between 
the Impact and a Critical Event.
8.2.3
Impact and Critical Events are interconnected, and they occur not only during 
acquisition but also in retention and expansion phases.

A Compelling Event vs. A Critical Event
There is a difference between a Compelling and a Critical Event. A Compelling 
Event is something that motivates action, often due to a positive opportunity or 
beneﬁt. It's like a carrot enticing a client forward. For example, a new technology 
that could boost productivity is a Compelling Event for adopting it. In contrast, a 
Critical Event is driven by a sense of urgency, usually because of potential 
negative outcomes or risks. It's more like a stick urging quick action to avoid 
harm. For instance, outdated software posing security risks is a Critical Event.
There is a direct relationship between Impact and a Critical Event. When you 
identify either a signiﬁcant Impact (like a potential loss) or a Critical Event (like a 
looming deadline), you can often infer the other. For example, uncovering a risk 
(Impact) may point to a regulatory compliance deadline (Critical Event), and vice 
versa. 
Understanding these events is crucial in SaaS, as it helps in prioritizing 
actions and decisions, both for you as a provider and for your clients. It's 
about identifying what drives a customer's decision—the allure of beneﬁt or 
the need to avoid detriment.
Why Do so many Organizations Get Critical Events Wrong?
We have found that most GTM teams are ill-prepared to discuss the events 
that cause a customer to commit. This leads to issues across the board: the 
lead generation team generates the wrong leads, the sales team consistently 
misses the forecast, and the customer success team sees a decline in revenue 
retention. All of these challenges can be attributed to several key issues related 
to Critical Events:
● Firstly, the GTM team often fails to engage in meaningful discussions about 
Critical Events. When customers provide information about a speciﬁc 
deadline, the GTM team members often fail to probe further by asking 
questions like, "Earlier, you mentioned you needed this product by August 22. 
What’s happening on that date?” This lack of exploration prevents a deeper 
understanding of the customer's sense of urgency.
262

---

## Page 263

C H A P T E R   0 8   |   O P E R A T I N G   M O D E L
● Secondly, the GTM team commonly confuses a Compelling Event with a 
Critical Event. For example, a renewal date really is a Compelling Event, as 
most software services do not immediately switch off if the renewal lapses. 
● Lastly, it's essential to recognize that what may be a Critical Event for the 
Decider (e.g., the fear of getting ﬁred) may be viewed as a Compelling Event 
for the stakeholder team. While a Critical Event prompts immediate action 
for the Decider, the stakeholder team may not see it as an immediate 
problem-solving opportunity.
What we can learn from this is that a Critical and a Compelling Event are forms 
of priority, and that it is a function of time:
Priority = Impact (Time)
This allows us to graph Priority on an XY chart, with Time (X-axis) versus Impact 
(Y-axis). When a priority crosses a certain threshold, it transforms a Compelling 
Event into a Critical one. This creates a characteristic unique to SaaS in that the 
customer's priority ﬂuctuates over time. This is in stark contrast with budget and 
ROI, which remain relatively stable over extended periods.
Priority is depicted as a function of ﬂuctuating impact over time, a concept teams may 
not be accustomed to handling—especially in contrast to static measures such as 
budget availability or a ﬁxed RoI commonly used in perpetual software sales.

A typical purchasing scenario involves a proposal deadline, which, while critical 
for the seller, maybe just a Compelling Event for the buyer with no immediate 
impact if missed. However, if the seller fails to meet this deadline, they risk 
disqualiﬁcation; to the seller, it is a Critical Event.
After the proposal is submitted, the customer goes dark, leading the GTM team 
to believe that the deal is lost, the project is delayed, or worse, canceled. 
Meanwhile, the buyer, lacking a timely solution, might experience a critical 
event, such as a security breach, leading to signiﬁcant negative consequences. 
Recovering from this, the buyer re-enters the bidding process. Still, this time, 
the customer has experienced a lack of Impact or negative Impact, and with a 
renewed sense of urgency, they activate their security solution of choice. 
Key insights from this scenario include:
● Priority is dynamic: The GTM team evolves from clear deadlines and 
meetings to no communication, illustrating the need to continuously 
gauge the customer's position and progression in the buying timeline.
● “Going dark” implies a compelling event: An absence of communication 
does not necessarily mean a lost deal or renewal. It merely prompts the GTM 
team to reassess the Impact presence of a  Critical Event.
● Recognizing an educated buyer: GTM reps should discern whether 
the customer has previously dealt with similar decisions and impacts, 
perhaps in a former role early on in the process. It takes a qualiﬁed 
resource, or educated buyer, to disqualify from the process.
● Differentiating retention strategies: Navigating customers through the 
stages differs from perpetual software sales, focusing on prioritization 
rather than budget or ROI. For example GTM teams must excel in 
developing strategies like a Critical Event Timeline (CET) to identify and act 
on time-sensitive decision drivers.
This example highlights the nuances unique to recurring revenue models, 
where the level of priority can change signiﬁcantly and rapidly, a concept often 
unfamiliar to many GTM organizations.

There Are Different Priority Levels 
Priority levels can be categorized as follows:
● Level 4. Business as Usual: Routine day-to-day operations with no 
signiﬁcant opportunities or threats present; the product is a “nice-to-have.”
● Level 3. Compelling Event: An opportunity that can provide value to the 
business. It's important but not yet urgent. It generally has no clear deadline 
or window of opportunity.
● Level 2. Critical Event: A situation demanding immediate action to avoid 
negative impacts. This can be the risk of loss or a signiﬁcant problem that 
can damage a business if not addressed quickly.
● Level 1. Mandatory Event: Involves critical deadlines or essential 
requirements, like regulatory compliance, with severe consequences 
for non-compliance, such as legal penalties or critical system failures.
Prioritization is not a one-time task; the more resources a customer consumes, 
the higher the costs become (CAC and CTS), necessitating more frequent 
reassessment. Although rare, in a healthy business, this may involve the ﬁring of 
a customer due to the disproportionate amount of resources they consume.

A Critical Event Timeline
A Critical Event Timeline (CET) refers to the sequence of time-bound events or 
milestones crucial in a customer's decision-making process. It comes from 
deep Enterprise sales techniques, where it was developed by Daniel J. Adams 
when selling Ariba Software. The timeline outlines the speciﬁc deadlines and 
signiﬁcant moments that impact the customer's purchasing or decision-making 
journey.
The goal of the CET is to help identify the time-sensitive factors that create a 
sense of urgency for the customer. It may include key dates such as proposal 
deadlines, contract renewal dates, project milestones, or other time-critical 
events inﬂuencing the customer's decision. By mapping out the Critical Event 
Timeline, the buyer and the seller can better understand the time constraints 
and prioritize their actions and strategies accordingly.
Critical Event Timeline - reverse order - starting with customer Impact.TABLE 8.1

A Critical Event Timeline highlights key activities needed to achieve the ﬁrst 
Impact. It allows the GTM team to plan and align their efforts to meet the 
customer's needs within the speciﬁed timeframe. It ensures that the 
necessary actions are taken at the right time to support the customer's 
decision-making process and maximize the chances of success.

## Page 267

C H A P T E R   0 8   |   O P E R A T I N G   M O D E L
The Critical Event Timeline has a few characteristics:
● It anchors itself to the day the customer gets what they want, which is 
Impact, rather than the date the seller gets what they wish, which is an 
executed contract signed.
● It starts with the most important deliverable, achieve ﬁrst Impact, and 
then works backward.
● It stays focused on a handful of tasks. The Critical Event Timeline is 
conﬁrmed with a short, stand-alone email that aﬃrms the dates. This 
message is likely going to be needed later, in case the event gets delayed. 
In summary, understanding the Critical Event Timeline is crucial for managing 
the time-sensitive factors inﬂuencing customer decision-making. GTM teams 
can use this timeline to strategically plan their actions, ensuring alignment with 
the customer's decision-making process.
The Decision
The decision involves the following parts which we are going to delve into next:
● Part 1. The Buying Center
● Part 2. The Decision-Making Process
● Part 3. The Decision Criteria
The decision is directly connected to what we learned in the previous paragraphs 
about the Situation (S), Pain (P), Impact (I), and Critical Event (CE).
We will link back to these elements, creating clarity how decisions are made, 
and how organizations can structure their GTM efforts.

The Buying Center 
In the B2B context, purchase, renewal, or expansion decisions are rarely made 
by a single person who also ends up being the sole user of the product. 
Research shows that as many as 20 people can be involved from the buyer's 
side. These individuals collectively form what is known as the buying center. 
The buying center comprises a group of individuals within an organization 
who are involved in the decision-making process for acquiring, retaining, or 
expanding products or services. A buyer center is a methodology that allows 
organizations to operate independently of job titles and instead focuses on the 
roles played by stakeholders, such as Initiators, Champions, and Deciders.
The buying center as a whole functions as a collective decision-making unit, 
responsible for evaluating options, conducting research, assessing solutions, 
and ultimately making purchase decisions. Each buying center member plays a 
speciﬁc role in inﬂuencing the decision-making process, with different priorities, 
criteria, and concerns. These roles can change over time. 
A description of the 9 roles that exist within the buying center.TABLE 8.2
Role* Description**
Initiators The ones who ﬁrst suggest or initiate the contact (S, P).
Users Individuals who will directly use the product or service (S, P , I).
Champions An advocate within the organization who helps the seller (S, P , I).
Deciders Members who make the ﬁnal purchasing decision (I, CE).
Gatekeepers Those who controls (vetoes) the decision process (I, CE).
Inﬂuencers People who provide information or criteria for evaluating options (I, CE).
Executive Buyer The person responsible to realize the impact (I, CE, D).
Approvers Individuals who authorize the proposed actions of deciders or buyers (I, D).
Purchaser The member who handles the actual procurement process (I, D).

A decision process for a mid-touch GTM motion involving 4 different roles.FIGURE 8.19
Using the above as an example, the decision-making process starts with an 
Initiator, who understands their company's current Situation and Pain and 
discovers a potential solution at an online event. The solution is then introduced 
to a Champion.
The Champion evaluates the product's capacity to deliver the desired Impact, 
typically through a discovery or demonstration call. In this call, the Champion's 
focus is to ascertain whether the solution can attain the Impact the company 
seeks. If the solution is deemed viable, the Champion brings a Decider into the 
conversation.
The Decider, who holds the authority to allocate resources, aligns the solution 
with the company's Impact needs within a speciﬁc timeframe. If missing this 
timeframe would result in adverse consequences, it is labeled a Critical Event; 
otherwise, it is a Compelling Event.
The Decision-Making Process
The decision-making process has 2 dimensions to which the various roles of the 
process are mapped in the right sequence. We then overlay the framework we 
just discussed (Situation, Pain, Impact, Critical Event, and Decision). This gives 
us an idea how decisions are made.

C H A P T E R   0 8   |   O P E R A T I N G   M O D E L
The Decider, with both resources and a deadline, will likely consult with a broader 
team before making a ﬁnal recommendation. It is common for GTM 
professionals to believe they are talking to a decision maker, while they are 
working with a Champion. Thut it is important to note that the role of the  
Decider role differs from the Champion's in that the Decider has access to the 
needed resources and has a delivery date to hit. 
The Executive Buyer manages the allocation of resources to achieve the 
company's objectives. Unlike the Decider, the Executive Buyer’s role extend to a 
corporate level, for example, they ensure adherence to a fair procurement 
process, the selection of long-term strategic partners, and they aid in ﬁnalizing 
the legal part of the contract and streamlining the procurement process.
To effectively navigate the decision-making process across all these roles, GTM 
professionals must have a deep understanding of the responsibilities and 
perspectives of each role. Therefore, it is crucial for them to build relationships 
and understand the Impact each role seeks. This requires mastery in active 
listening and effective communication (see Annex G). Gaining a deep 
understanding of the Impact a customer wants, and when, allows them to 
engage effectively with the different roles within the buying center.
A More Complex Deal Has a More Complex Buying Center
As the business grows, so does the complexity of the decision processes. 
The decision process gains complexity as more people are mapped to each 
role and as more roles are introduced. The buying center increases from 4 
to 7 roles by adding the roles of Users, Inﬂuencers, and Gatekeepers. Let’s break 
down these roles.
Gatekeepers can act as barriers to the purchasing decision. They possess 
authority but not the power to decide; they exert control by managing the 
ﬂow of information to various members of the buying center or team. In 
this capacity, they hold signiﬁcant inﬂuence over the decision by regulating 
the dissemination of pertinent information.

The complexity of the decision process can further increase when customers 
seek large and complex B2B deals involving the replacement of entire systems, 
such as ERP or CRM replacements. In such a scenario, multiple buying centers 
may exist throughout the company. Each buying center can be seen as a 
separate hurdle that needs to be overcome. Additionally, there may be 
competition among these buying centers, where approval from one buying 
center may pose a challenge when dealing with the next. By using sentiment 
for each role, we get an idea of where we stand with the decision process.
Inﬂuencers contribute to formulating and determining the speciﬁcations of the 
product or service. They evaluate potential suppliers and recommend the ones 
that best satisfy speciﬁc needs. Their input carries weight in the decision- 
making process. 
Users are the individuals who use the product or service. While they may not 
always be directly involved in the buying process, their feedback and product 
performance evaluation are critical in the overall decision-making. In recent 
years users have risen in prominence. They have the ear of the decider through 
which they can sway a decision.

The Decision Criteria
When it comes to subscription-based products, the decision-making process 
differs from that of traditional perpetual products. Unlike conventional products, 
where budget and return on investment are key factors, subscription products 
face a different challenge. Most buyers have the ﬁnancial means to afford a 
subscription-based service, and the subscription model inherently offers a 10x  
ROI. This holds true for the vast array of 35,000+ subscription products available.
The real challenge for subscription-based products lies in the intense 
competition they face. With dozens of products vying for the same budget, and 
hundreds of alternative products that can deliver the same, if not a better ROI, 
while ﬁtting within the buyer's budget. This leaves buyers wondering whether 
they genuinely need the product, and need it now. It is crucial for sellers and 
account managers (AMs), to help customers prioritize their spending by 
showcasing the unique and lasting Impact that the product can deliver over 
time. Most buyers follow an arbitrary decision-making process that involves the 
following steps:
● Step 1: Based on a series of discovery calls with various stakeholders across 
the company, determine the decision criteria.
● Step 2: Identify various options to address these decision criteria, such 
as competitors and substitutes. No action (indecision) is commonly 
seen as an option.
● Step 3: Establish the ranking of each option based on the decision 
criteria through research, including factors like execution capabilities, 
analyst reports, or customer feedback from public review sites.
Following this process, buyers often prioritize price as a key criterion, which 
can result in a price competitor prevailing over you. When the decision 
involves multiple decision-makers, a weighted ranking is applied to justify 
the purchasing decision.

Historically, decision criteria were stack-ranked and weighted, giving an academic 
facade to the decision-making process. However, this often masked the subjectivity of 
the decision. In contrast, using Impact as a criterion shifts the decision towards 
causality. This allows at a later date, to see if the promised Impact was achieved.
FIGURE 8.21
● Step 4: Determine the Impact of each criterion. To assist your clients 
in making the right selection, it is crucial to help them understand and 
demonstrate the Impact each decision criterion has on their business. 
This includes considerations such as revenue increase, cost reduction, 
and improvements in the user experience. 
In a customer-centric world we have to embrace the paradigm that a well- 
educated customer generally ends up making the right decision. This means 
that we should focus on educating them accordingly.
Unlike buyers of perpetual software solutions, those opting for subscription 
services expect near-immediate results, e.g., instant Impact. Consequently, the 
magnitude of this Impact and its timing have become dominant factors in the 
decision-making process. This shift requires an additional step: determining 
the Impact of each criterion (see Figure 8.21).

Educated buyers can assess the Impact of each criterion and make informed

focusing on price. As a sales professional, you may need to guide customers in 
identifying and evaluating their decision criteria. It is the responsibility of the 
GTM team to help a customer uncover the true Impact of each criterion.
In the example shown in Figure 8.22, the stack ranking is rearranged compared 
to the weighted ranking presented in Figure 8.21, by evaluating the potential 
effects on revenue and cost reduction, among other factors.

Your client may make this kind of decision only once or twice over a period 
of years, whereas you, as a sales professional, will help dozens of customers

to demonstrate the Impact to your client. In previous work, we presented the 
SPICED framework as a method to help you establish the Impact with the 
client during your discovery meetings and demonstrations.
Reprioritizing the Decision Criteria
You can help your customer show Impact by increasing revenue, reducing 
costs, and improving customer experience (simple dashboards) and customer 
interaction (fewer clicks to get work done). This allows you to help your 
customer re-prioritize how you compare to competitors and substitutes.

Important Traits of SPICED
SPICED has important traits that ensure that every interaction throughout the 
customer journey is connected and meaningful. As a result it can be applied to 
any touchpoints with the customer, allowing teams to validate information, 
qualify prospects, ensure ongoing alignment, and identify risks or opportunities. 
This effectiveness is derived from the following traits:
● Customer-Centric: SPICED strongly emphasizes understanding and 
delivering customer Impact, making it a customer-centric framework.
● Sequential: SPICED follows a logical progression, where understanding 
the customer's Situation precedes addressing the Pain, which precedes 
achieving the desired Impact.
● Causal: SPICED recognizes a causal relationship between the elements. 
It acknowledges that the cause (Situation and Pain) leads to the effect 
(Impact) which precedes the decision. Causal also points to an important 
factor: if you miss one of the SPICED elements, your outcome may be 
correlation based. In other words, the entire decision process may be 
based on the wrong assumption.
● Decision as an Outcome: SPICED understands that the decision-making 
process is driven by the customer's need for Impact and positions itself as 
a natural outcome of having done the proper groundwork. This applies not 
only to a new opportunity’s commitment to a purchase, but also to a 
customer renewing or expanding.
By aligning all customer-facing roles around SPICED, organizations can ensure 
that teams operate uniformly. This approach promotes collaboration and 
consistency. It serves to help achieve growth through customer acquisition, 
retention, and expansion. 
Can you imagine what would happen if you would apply this framework to the 
entire customer journey? That's exactly where we're headed next: exploring how 
SPICED can be used to interconnect all means and methods in use.

SPICED IN ACTION
In the previous section, we diagnosed a customer and uncovered the Impact by 
exploring their Situation and Pain. We then applied these elements — Situation, 
Pain, and Impact — to craft a Customer Story. Next, we pinpointed the Critical 
Event and utilized all the SPICED components to inform the Decision-Making 
Process and shape the Decision Criteria. SPICED is now operating as an 
intermediary, akin to an Interface in the world of software development.
Departments have operated in silos for years. What if we leverage SPICED not 
only as an intermediary between actions but also as an interface between the 
means and methods used across various departments, fostering cross-functional 
and cross-departmental interoperability? Our focus will be on the most 
widely-used tactics and strategies in today's market:

INCREASE IN RELEVANCE
Interfacing Means and Methods in Lead Generation
Lead generation and lead development have drastically evolved over the  past 
years. Addressing someone by their name in an email was considered 
relevant in 2015; today, this is no longer good enough, so what to do next?  
As mentioned previously, SPICED has the trait of being causal, meaning 
Impact is based on a Pain, which in turn is based on a Situation. This trait can 
be used in lead generation and lead development, as the reverse is also 
true—knowing the Impact a customer wants is way more relevant to them 
than knowing their Pain or Situation. Reaching out to someone based on  the 
Impact they want to achieve is more relevant to them than reaching out 
based on the Pain they may experience (see Figure 8.25). This trait is the 
foundation for a variety of lead generation and lead development techniques.

Three Main Methodologies for Lead Generation 
A wide array of means and methods are used for generating leads, including 
content engagement, social media, personalized cold emails, referrals and 
aﬃliates, remarketing, events, and Search Engine Optimization. These various 
approaches can be categorized under 3 primary methodologies:
● Inbound: Attract prospects using content, SEO, social media events, etc.
● Outbound: Reach out to prospects via emails, calls, social, referrals, and ads.
● Targeting: Use insights to pinpoint and focus on companies you can impact.
Let’s delve deeper into each of these methodologies next.
Inbound
The inbound process focuses on assigning the right resources to the 
opportunity. The inbound customer often expresses a Pain due to a Situation 
they are experiencing. Therefore sellers need to diagnose the customer's 
desired Impact, and make sure they can deliver it. The Request for Proposal 
(RFP) and Request for Quotation (RFQ) processes for larger deals align with 
this approach from the buyer's perspective, as the buyer sets the stage with the 
desired Impact, timeframe, and Decision criteria.
FIGURE 8.26 By overlaying SPICED onto the Bowtie model and mapping inbound and outbound 
methodologies across the customer journey, we gain insight into the signiﬁcant 
differences between the two.

Outbound
Being relevant to the customer is crucial for outbound lead generation. 
Professional prospectors spend days researching to establish a list of 
prospective clients who are a good ﬁt. They then focus on those most likely 
to have an underlying pain point, often identiﬁed through social media 
expressions. In this sense, outbound simply reverses the inbound process 
presented in Figure 8.26. Over the years, the focus on relevance has evolved. 
It's moved from situational relevance, such as knowing someone’s name, to 
understanding their pain points, often gleaned from their social interactions. 
It's only logical that the next generation of outbound will require sellers 
to understand the Impact they can bring. This is where AI will play a signiﬁcant 
role. For those who need immediate Impact, such as due to a government 
mandate, determining its priority becomes crucial. Here, priority is a function 
of Impact and time, resulting in a Critical Event.
In outbound prospecting, you reach out to a speciﬁc individual across 
hundreds or thousands of companies. Targeting leverages the same 
principles but focuses on an entire account—a topic we'll discuss next.
FIGURE 8.27 The difference in generating leads through outbound prospecting and targeting differs 
in the number of individuals they address in various roles across a company.

Customer Proﬁle (ICP) development. The key is not to use AI to produce more 
cold outbound email campaigns but rather to use AI to increase relevance, 
combined with identifying the best channel.
Targeting
In the targeting process, we ﬁrst identify existing customers we want more of 
and then determine the SPICED characteristics they all have in common to 
create a tiered targeted account list and strategy. It allows organizations to 
regulate the money spent on lead generation to match the size of the 
opportunity, which in turn is based on the Impact. This allows us to design 
campaigns in which we allocate as much as $5,000 to develop top tier 
targets, whereas third tier targets may only cost $50 per targeted account.
This helps us identify a group of qualiﬁed accounts. Next, we need to target a 
speciﬁc group of individuals within these accounts, referred to as personas.

Ideal Customer Proﬁle vs. Buyer Persona
ICPs and Buyer Personas serve complimentary but distinct purposes. ICPs are 
detailed descriptions of a company's ideal clients—those who would beneﬁt the 
most from its products or services. They are essential for guiding marketing 
campaigns and sales strategies, ensuring eﬃcient lead qualiﬁcation, and 
preventing indiscriminate “spray and pray” marketing.
In comparison, a Buyer Persona is a semi-ﬁctional representation of an actual 
customer, focusing on demographics, goals, motivators, and challenges. Rather 
than concentrating on job titles, personas delve into the challenges individuals 
face and their relationship to the solutions offered by your product or service, 
encapsulated by the SPICED framework.

Qualiﬁcation
One of the most commonly used methodologies in the sales process Is 
MEDDIC. MEDDIC is a stage-based deal qualiﬁcation methodology that is 
particularly effective in complex sales environments where multiple 
stakeholders are involved. It emphasizes understanding the buyer's needs, 
the decision-making process, and key players in the organization.
MEDDIC stands for:
● Metrics: Understanding the buyer's speciﬁc metrics and the Key 
Performance Indicators (KPIs) they must achieve.
● Economic Buyer: Identifying and engaging with the person who has 
the authority to make purchasing decisions.
● Decision Criteria: Understanding the criteria the buyer will use to decide.
● Decision Process: Knowing the steps and timeline involved in the buyer's 
decision-making process.
● Identify Pain: Uncovering the buyer's challenges, problems, or pain points.
● Champion: Finding a Champion or internal advocate within the buyer's 
organization.
By  addressing these critical aspects, sales teams can increase their 
chances of winning deals and minimize the risk of losing opportunities 
due to misunderstandings or misalignment. It is amazing how robust 
MEDDIC still is over 25 years after it was conceived.
MEDDIC is the quintessential tool applied at the departmental level, 
speciﬁcally within sales and predominantly in Enterprise sales. It's the 
Lightsaber of the Old Guard. But don’t underestimate it; it is an effective 
method. By making MEDDIC interoperable with SPICED we can interface it 
with all other means and methods used in SaaS, such as ABM. Next we 
will demonstrate this by making MEDDIC interoperable with SPICED.

How to Make MEDDIC Applicable to Recurring Revenue
Originally conceived as a deal qualiﬁcation methodology for perpetual software 
sales, MEDDIC can be adapted for recurring revenue by aligning it with SPICED. 
We are going to do this in 3 steps:
1. Understand the (M)etrics and (I)dentify the Pain Points.
2. Determine the (D)ecision Criteria.
3. Establish the (D)ecision Process, (E)conomic Buyer, and (C)hampion.
We are going to delve deeper into each of these steps next.
Step 1. Understand the Metrics and Identify the Pain Points.
Identify the metrics, as in the Impact your solution brings to the customer. The 
Impact-based framework detailed in Section 8.2.2 provides a two-dimensional 
view of "How to Uncover Impact" and "Identify Pain." 
It allows managers to leverage their investment in MEDDIC and expand 
that with a “and here is how you can”—from knowledge to know-how. Whereas 
MEDDIC only looks for the rational impact, through SPICED it also offers you 
emotional impact.

● Step 3. Determine the Decision Process Using SPICED.
Historically, MEDDIC was used for perpetual software sales, priced in 
the millions of dollars, explaining the focus on getting consensus across 
a wide variety of decision-makers involved in the decision process. 
Combining MEDDIC with the role of a buying center provides us with a 
roadmap that allows managers to tell what needs to happen and how 
to do it.
For instance, managers often instruct their GTM reps across acquisition 
and expansion to get to the decision-maker (Decider). However, SPICED 
shows that a Champion is driven by Impact, whereas the Decider is 
motivated by the both Impact and the timing for when that Impact is 
needed, e.g., Critical Event. 
FIGURE 8.31 Quantitative decision criteria leverage the Impact uncovered in Step 1.

 ecision Criteria
● Step 2. Determine the Decision Criteria. 
Once we have identiﬁed the Impact, we can make it part of the decision 
criteria, in which we help customers establish the rational impact so they can 
communicate with their stakeholders using a quantitative approach.

In conclusion,  MEDDIC helps with Deal Qualiﬁcation covering 3 actions: 
Uncovering Impact, Understanding the Decision-Making Process, and 
Establishing Decision Criteria. The application of SPICED over time within each of 
these actions offers a step-by-step guide on “How to uncover Impact” and “How 
to establish the Decision Criteria.” With SPICED interwoven in these action, it 
naturally makes MEDDIC interoperable with SPICED.
This is akin to each action having a standardized USB port, allowing it to 
interface with any other USB device. In this context, each action being 
mapped to SPICED enables interaction with all other means and methods 
that adhere to SPICED.

Interfacing Means and Methods in Sales
Choosing the right sales methodology is crucial in B2B sales-assisted selling, 
where each customer requires a personalized approach. Various B2B sales 
methodologies are tailored for speciﬁc buyer–seller dynamics. This chapter 
dissects the characteristics of the following methodologies: 
● Transactional Selling
● Solution Selling
● Consultative Selling
● Provocative Selling 
A key distinction among these sales methodologies lies in the point within 
the customer journey at which the seller engages with the customer.

Transactional Selling
The transactional sales process is a reactionary one. It focuses on quick, 
one-time sales without a signiﬁcant emphasis on building deep customer 
relationships. It's often used for simpler, lower-cost, or commodity items in 
which customers know what they want and are price-shopping for lead times. 
They may be willing to forfeit a speciﬁc feature if it can save them a lot of 
money. In transactional selling it is all about the product itself, and it is not 
uncommon for customers to prefer excluding salespeople from the process or 
replacing them with automation. Increasingly, transactional models are 
adopting a PLG approach.
When to use it? Transactional selling shines in high-volume, high-velocity, 
inbound, or low-cost environments. Consider it when you're targeting deals 
with an ACV of less than $2,400, a sales cycle shorter than 30 days, and 
expecting to close over 20 deals per month per seller.

C H A P T E R   0 8   |   O P E R A T I N G   M O D E L
Solution Selling
This sales approach focuses on identifying and addressing speciﬁc problems. 
It's often used reactively with inbound customers who already understand their 
needs and have some knowledge about potential solutions. These customers 
aren't solely price shopping; they're seeking particular features and may be 
willing to pay more for them. Typically, by the time they initiate contact, they've 
narrowed their options to a few providers. In solution selling, it's crucial to 
conduct a brief discovery and quickly move to a product demo, which helps 
clarify the exact impact the customer is seeking. A follow-up with a demo 
recording for internal sharing is recommended.
When to use it? Solution selling is most effective in medium-volume, 
high-velocity scenarios, primarily with inbound leads. It suits deals around a 
$10,000 Annual Contract Value (ACV), with a 30-day sales cycle, targeting 5 
to 10 monthly deals per account executive.
Next up is consultative selling, which delves into developing a customer’s 
needs, using advanced question-based sales techniques to match up to a 
tailored solution that reﬂects market expertise.
FIGURE 8.36 Solution selling commonly follows an inbound lead, and is centered around a demo.

“Hope company 
X will respond  
to our RFQ.”
Consultative Selling
Consultative selling involves early investment in educating the customer, 
using market experience to highlight important aspects. This might involve 
campaigns addressing customer Pain and showcasing your solution's 
Impact. This approach positions the seller as an expert, an educator, and 
you ﬁnd yourself assisting the customers in diagnosing their problems and 
ﬁnding appropriate solutions. Notable among consultative methodologies is 
SPIN selling, which employs a question-based technique. Expertise is 
demonstrated by aligning with customer requirements, potentially aiding in 
RFP/RFQ creation. Proof of Concept (POC) is common but it will extend the 
sales cycle and increase costs as a tech-skilled resources is added.
When to use it? Opt for consultative selling when dealing with complex 
solutions requiring multiple decision-makers, such as selling platforms like ERP 
and CRM priced between $20k and $100k ACV. Expect a sales cycle that is 
measured in months and usually results in 1 to 3 deals per quarter per rep. 
As we transition from consultative selling, we arrive at provocative selling—
a methodology that challenges and disrupts conventional thinking.

Provocative Selling
Subscription-based services commonly involve innovative solutions. When 
presenting an innovative solution that challenges the status quo, you cannot 
solely rely on the consultative process, as clients may not even realize there is a 
problem, let alone see it as urgent. Provocative selling involves challenging the 
customer's status quo. It's used when clients may not recognize a lurking 
problem or its urgency. Instead of following conventional processes like 
RFP/RFQ, provocative selling creates urgency by showing a customer they are 
missing out on signiﬁcant Impact, which creates a sense of urgency.
When to use it?  Provocative selling is most effective for high-value, innovative 
solutions, typically measured in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. It's 
particularly suited for addressing a CEO's major priorities, such as outpacing 
competitors or entering new markets. However, this approach demands a deep 
understanding of the customer's situation and extensive market and product 
knowledge. The penalty for failure is signiﬁcant.
The challenger sale methodology, which pioneered provocative selling, gained 
popularity in early 2012 following the publication of a book by the same name 
authored by Matthew Dixon and Brent Adamson.

Four Different Methodologies
We discussed 4 different sales-assisted methodologies:
● Transactional Selling: Focuses on pitching the product directly to the 
customer.
● Solution Selling: Emphasizes discovery and product demonstrations to 
address speciﬁc customer problems.
● Consultative Selling: Centers on diagnosing customer needs and educating 
them about solutions.
● Provocative Selling: Involves prescribing innovative solutions to challenge 
and change the customer's status quo.
In a large-scale business with multiple GTM motions it is likely organizations will 
have a multiple sales methodologies in place. Each of these methodologies 
requires integration with the various lead generation techniques we discussed 
earlier, and post-sales activities. Since they all operate on SPICED we can 
integrate them all together.

Customer Success
Today there a few standardized means and methods in place in Customer 
Success. This presents an incredible opportunity; it essentially offers a clean 
slate. This allows us to implement SPICED in customer success teams from 
the start which can bring transformative beneﬁts. We are going to do this by 
mapping SPICED to every key activity. When done right, it integrates 
seamlessly with the Acquisition, or the left side of the Bowtie. As we’ve 
discussed, the right half of the Bowtie includes 3 stages: Onboarding, 
Retention, and Expansion. In each stage, we have picked a handful of 
moments (see Table 8.3).

● Moment 1. Handoff
● Moment 2. Renewal
● Moment 3. Expansion Process
This will demonstrate that by integrating SPICED into individual actions, all 
methods the rely on these actions by defacto become SPICED compliant the 
same way MEDDIC became SPICED compliant by integrating SPICED into the 3 
core actions: Diagnose, Decision-Making Process, and Decision Criteria. 
Let’s start by showing how SPICED is integrated in Handoff.

 The drastic change in the relationship that occurs the moment both parties commit.FIGURE 8.40
Moment 1. Handoff (to Customer Success)
In SaaS companies, the handoff from sales to customer success is more 
than a mere administrative step; it's a pivotal moment that sets the stage for 
the customer's entire journey. This process usually kicks off when both 
parties sign a Mutual Commitment, often focused on achieving a particular 
set of goals.

S P I CE D
Imagine this scenario: It's a Friday afternoon, and after days of negotiating 
terms and hashing out details, both the buyer and seller teams ﬁnally reach a 
Mutual Commitment. Despite the high stakes and tension, everyone has been 
playing their roles perfectly—sitting, metaphorically, on opposite sides of the 
table. But come Monday, when the ink dries on the contract, there's a noticeable 
shift. Suddenly, it's like everyone has moved their chairs to sit together on the 
same side of the table. 
Now, the goals are aligned, changing the dynamics of the relationship. This 
creates a golden opportunity for the customer success team or, in the case of 
PLG, the systems and processes in place. The shift from the sales team to the 
customer success team is not merely about ticking boxes. While a checklist may 
provide a sense of progress, it doesn't necessarily translate to meaningful 
achievement. This is the time to delve deeper, reconﬁrming the customer's real 
needs, preferred outcomes, and timelines. Rather than just helping the customer 
achieve their ﬁrst impact, this period is ripe for strategic moves, such as 
introducing upselling opportunities and suggesting cross-selling options.

Enter SPICED. This framework transforms the handoff into a seamless, 
impactful experience. It empowers the customer success team or onboarding 
representative to validate and potentially revise the customer's desired impact 
and timeline. As a standardized methodology, SPICED can be incorporated into 
various systems and training protocols, elevating onboarding from a mere set of 
tasks to a true competitive edge. With each iteration, the SPICED framework 
aims to continually reﬁne and improve the customer experience.
Moment 2. Renewal
View renewals as an opportunity to reassess Impact by incorporating the 
following                    questions into the renewal process:
● Has their Situation or Pain changed since the initial purchase?
● Have they realized the intended Impact from using the product?
● How does the achieved Impact align with their corporate initiatives/KPIs?
● Do they plan to continue utilizing the product for the same Impact?
● Is there an upcoming Critical Event that requires more or different Impact?
These questions deepen the understanding of how your customer beneﬁts from 
your product paving the way for scalable, sustainable, and durable growth.

Moment 3. Expansion through White Space Planning
Expansion does not have to be reactionary to a customer’s needs. Whitespace 
planning is a process that identiﬁes the additional needs for Impact–not 
Product–outside the original scope based on the impact a customer needs.
Today, most whitespace planning is based on a combination of the Situation and 
Pain, such as the number of employees vs. the amount of seats sold. 
Instead we recommend to prioritize whitespace planning based on Impact as 
depicted next (see Figure 8.42). Users of a PLG motion may choose to replace 
Impact with Monthly/Daily Active Usage. 
Customers are categorized on 
the impact they extract from 
the product, not the product 
itself. Customer 1

The whitespace areas—represented by the empty circles in the ﬁgure—indicate 
opportunities for expansion by offering additional products or services that could 
provide the Impact in these underutilized areas. The segmented pie charts in 
Customer 4’s and Customer 5's rows suggest that they are utilizing multiple 
products but still have whitespace opportunities to achieve a full Impact.
The lack of utilization the full Impact of purchased products exposes a company 
to risk as those customers are more likely to churn. This can be remedied by a 
Customer Marketing campaign that highlights best practices for achieving 
Impact B and C based on insights gained from working with Customers 1 and 2.

In this whitespace planning moved from Situation and Pain to Impact since this 
is more relevant to the customer. You may recall we discussed the importance 
of relevance earlier ( Figure 8.23) and its relationship to SPICED. 
From this we can learn that it can also be applied to Critical Events and Decision. 
In case of Critical Event, you can create a whitespace based on which 
companies are hiring, or in case of the Decision, you can map how widespread 
your product is being used across different stakeholders (see Figure 8.43).
EXEC 
BUYER
When stakeholders across a customer’s buying center, like those at Customer 1, 
fully engage with a service, there’s no whitespace, signaling complete utilization 
of the product’s impact. Conversely, when engagement is lacking among 
stakeholders—as with Customer 3—whitespace is revealed. By weaving a 
product into the workﬂows of various roles, a company solidiﬁes its presence 
and boosts the potential for retention and expansion.
Here's the crux: Impact-based whitespace planning focuses on what the users 
get from a product beyond mere usage, thus increasing customer retention 
and paving the way for growth. Given that expanding existing customer sales is 
more economical than acquiring new ones, whitespace planning becomes 
crucial for driving scalable, sustainable, and lasting growth.

The Creation of an Operating Model
In this section, we've learned how to create interaction between different 
means and methods through SPICED. Employing Buyer Personas has allowed 
us to identify distinct roles within the Buying Center, which we've seamlessly 
integrated into the decision process with the aid of SPICED. Combining this 
with a targeting approach we can create an ABM approach. 
Next we mapped critical actions, such as Uncovering Impact, the Decision- 
Making Process, and Decision Criteria, directly to the MEDDIC methodology, 
thereby making MEDDIC interoperable with ABM. 
Furthermore, we've interconnected various Customer Success actions by 
applying the SPICED framework. Essentially, SPICED serves as the unifying 
thread that weaves all methods and practices across the customer journey 
together, akin to how Apple's iOS provides a cohesive platform for millions of 
apps on the iPhone.

Mapping these actions to the data model crystallizes into the recurring revenue

● A standard model in the Bowtie that cover the entire customer journey;
● A common customer-centric language centered on Impact; and 
● A uniform methodology that creates interoperability between all actions

Operators of recurring revenue businesses face signiﬁcant challenges 
when managing multiple Go-To-Market motions, often struggling with a 
plethora of incompatible tools and methods. This complexity primarily 
arises during rapid growth phases of startups, where the absence of 
established processes leads to the ad-hoc adoption of various practices 
introduced by new hires. As these companies grow, they encounter a mix of 
tools and methodologies that impede eﬃciency and effectiveness. 
Compounding the issue are factors like short tenures of executives and 
the diverse approaches promoted by tool vendors, which further increase 
complexity. Therefore, interoperability is essential for ensuring consistent 
customer experiences and maintaining operational eﬃciency in 
subscription-based businesses.
To orchestrate a uniﬁed customer experience across all GTM motions, 
departments, functions, roles, and geographies of the GTM organization, 
companies need to take 3 steps:
● Step 1. Create a standardized data model: We recommend you replace 
the funnel with the Bowtie to align all your metrics.

customer-centric language spoken across the entire customer journey. 
Step 3. Deploy a uniform methodology: Use SPICED as a standard interface to 
ensure all actions, means and methods are interoperable. SPICED stands for:
● Situation

As of late 2021, fewer than 2 out of every 100 cloud companies that raised over 
$3 million reached $100M in ARR, and only 2 out of every 1,000 reached $1B in 
ARR. These success rates have since been steadily declining. The purpose of 
revenue architecture is to boost these success rates. In the ﬁrst part of this 
chapter, we will explore the Growth Model, revealing that nearly all companies 
follow a similar and predictable path. Along the way, they encounter the same 
hurdles, referred to as the 12 revenue breakpoints. In the second part of this 
chapter, we will present solutions to overcome these revenue breakpoints.
THE GROWTH MODEL EXPLAINED
The Growth Model can be broken down into the following components:
● Growth Patterns (9.1.1)
● Growth Rates  (9.1.2)
● Growth Stages  (9.1.3)
● Growth Trends  (9.1.4)
● Growth Funding  (9.1.5)
Putting these growth components together we get:
● The Growth Model  (9.1.6)
What we are going to learn is that companies with a recurring revenue stream 
follow a very similar, and predictable, trajectory.

In a subscription-based business like SaaS, the "Compound Effect" refers to 
the cumulative impact of recurring revenue over time, leading to 
exponential growth. Explained in detail in Chapter 2, here is how it works:
● In a subscription business like SaaS, customers typically pay a 
monthly or annual fee to use the software. This creates a stream 
of recurring revenue that has a level of predictability to it.
● The Compound Effect takes hold when the business retains a 
large part of its recurring revenue and expands this through 
upsells, cross-sells, or price increases, such as through tiered 
pricing models. 
● Retaining customers not only contributes to revenue in the 
current period but also, in all likelihood, in subsequent periods.
● Over time, the total revenue grows as new revenue is added and 
existing revenue is retained. Each cohort of new customers added 
in previous periods contributes to compounding revenue growth. 
This is different from an ownership model wherein revenue from a 
customer is often realized in a single period.
● The longer a customer stays, the more valuable they become, as 
the initial acquisition cost is distributed over a more extended 
period. It means that the proﬁtability of each customer tends to 
increase over time.
● As more customers use the service, network effects attract more 
users and creates a positive feedback loop that further 
accelerates growth.
The Compound Effect underlines the importance of not just acquiring new 
customers, but, more crucially, retaining them and maximizing their value 
over time. It is a balancing act for management teams that requires a deep 
understanding of how the recurring revenue engine works.

Growth Patterns
Growth patterns describe a company's revenue expansion over time, 
characterized by distinct stages, trends, and metrics. There are several growth 
patterns as can be seen next (see Figure 9.1)

A linear growth pattern represents a steady and consistent increase over time, 
while an exponential growth pattern involves rapid and proportional expansion. 
In contrast, a logarithmic growth patterns follows a curve showing diminishing 
returns. The logistic or S-curve growth pattern begins with exponential growth 
but levels off as resources become limited. The bell curve growth pattern 
describes a symmetrical distribution of values, often seen in statistics, where 
most data points cluster around the mean. We can ﬁnd these growth patterns in 
well-known companies; the next table provides a number of examples of 
companies and the current growth pattern they exhibit.

The Compound Effect of a subscription businesses, such as SaaS, is closely 
aligned with an S-curve growth pattern due to the way recurring revenue 
compounds over time. Here is how it works:
● Early Stage: Initially, when a subscription business is newly established, 
growth tends to be slow. This is due to factors like early market entry 
challenges, the need to establish product-market ﬁt, and the initial effort 
required in customer acquisition. During this phase, the Compound Effect 
is irrelevant because the customer base and recurring revenue are still 
small.
● Middle Stage: As the business begins to gain traction and acquire more 
customers, the effects of customer retention and recurring revenue start 
to compound. Each new customer adds to the recurring revenue base, and 
retained customers from previous periods continue to contribute, leading 
to a rapid increase in total revenue. This is where the Compound Effect 
becomes more pronounced and the business experiences accelerated 
growth. Network effects further enhance this growth.
● Maturity Stage: Eventually, the business matures, and the growth rate 
starts to plateau as the total addressable market becomes saturated.   
The customer acquisition costs and the cost to serve will increase as the 
easy-to-reach customers are already acquired, and the rate of adding new 
revenue will start balancing out with the churn. During this phase, while 
the business continues to grow, it does so at a slower rate compared to 
the middle stage. The Compound Effect is still at play, but its impact on 
growth rate diminishes as the business approaches market saturation.
The does not imply that companies cannot grow further; they absolutely 
can. However, further growth requires exploring other avenues, such as 
penetrating new markets, launching new products, or making  
acquisitions.
The combination of these 3 stages—initial slow growth, rapid growth in the 
middle stage, and eventual plateauing–forms the characteristic S-curve.

Example of the S-Curve
Next we are using an X-Y framework in which we plot ARR on the vertical axis, 
and time, measured in quarters, on the horizontal axis. We then chart publicly 
available quarterly revenue data from DataDog within this framework. The graph 
reveals that until mid-2022, DataDog traversed the classic S-curve all the way up 
to an inﬂection point in 2022

The inﬂection point was the result of the SaaS crash resulting in a reduced 
growth rate. DataDog was not alone in this; the SaaS crash had the same effect 
on almost all SaaS companies.  As of 2024, it is still unclear if this slowdown 
signiﬁes a permanent shift for SaaS companies, indicative of a reduced TAM, or 
if their growth rate will rebound. Only time will tell.
Guidelines for Understanding Revenue Growth Patterns
It's crucial to understand that graphs, such as the above, can obscure the 
true nature of growth patterns. To decipher a growth pattern, consider the 
following guidelines:
● Data Quality: Always verify the accuracy and reliability of the data used 
in the graph, particularly in GTM operations where data are often drawn 
from different sources that do not adhere to a common data structure.

C H A P T E R   0 9   |   G R O W T H   M O D E L
● Examine the Scale of the Revenue Axis: Pay close attention to 
whether the revenue axis is logarithmic. This is especially important 
because exponential revenue growth appears linear on a logarithmic 
scale. Misinterpreting the axis scale will lead to incorrect conclusions 
about the growth rate.
● Zoom Out for Perspective: Zoom in close enough, and any growth 
curve will eventually appear linear. Thus, zooming out to gain a broader 
perspective at times is essential to determine the growth pattern.
● Contextualize with Timeframe: Consider the timeframe represented in 
the graph. Short-term ﬂuctuations might give an inaccurate impression 
of long-term trends. A longer time frame provides a clearer picture of 
the growth trajectory.
● Watch for Inﬂection Points: Keep an eye out for inﬂection points where 
the direction or trajectory of a company's growth changes noticeably. 
These points signify a change in the growth pattern that can have a 
drastic impact on future growth. It is crucial to identify and navigate 
these inﬂection points effectively, as they require strategic adjustments 
and decisions to adapt to changing market conditions.
With this in mind we are going to analyze the Growth Rate next.
Growth Rates
The growth rate refers to the percentage increase in revenue, subscribers, or 
customers over a speciﬁc period of time. The growth rate is indicative of the 
market's hunger for a solution, the company’s ability to meet that demand, and 
the effectiveness of customer acquisition, retention, and expansion.  
What sets a recurring revenue business apart is that it is expected to conquer 
the market "by storm," reﬂecting an extraordinary high growth rate, much higher 
than almost any other industry. To keep up such a high velocity companies need 
to have the resources in place long before they need them. This makes 
understanding and predicting growth essential in planning for it.

How to Calculate (Annual) Growth Rate
A well-funded late-stage startup is expected to grow 20% to 100% year over year. 
For example, DataDog, founded in 2010, reported an annual revenue of $1.675B 
for the year 2022, a 62.7% increase over the $1.029B reported the previous year. 
The growth rate is calculated as follows:
Growth Rate  = 
Let's compare the annual growth rate of 62.7% of DataDog at $1.7B to Ford, a 
100+-year-old Enterprise company, which grew 14.8% to $174.23B in the 12 
months ending September 30, 2023.
Compound Growth Rate 
Whereas the growth rate tells us the immediate change from one period to 
the next, the compound growth rate (CGR) gives us a smoothed average rate 
that accounts for ups and downs over multiple periods, such as seasonality. 
Compound growth rate is considered a more nuanced and informative 
measure for assessing long-term performance vs. annual growth rate
Revenue(End) - Revenue(Begin)
Revenue(Begin)
Revenue(Begin) is the beginning value of the period over which it is measured
Revenue(End) is the ending value of the period over which it is measured
Annual Growth Rate =

Period is the time of measurements. This can be annually (CAGR) or monthly (CMGR).
The –1 converts the growth ratio over the period into an annualized growth rate.

When it comes to startups seeking Series A or B funding, a CMGR of over 10% is 
considered healthy. To put it in perspective, a CMGR of 10% translates to roughly 
3x year-over-year growth, which is a strong indicator of the market demand and 
your business's Scalability.
Annual Compound Growth Rate
You may ﬁnd your investors look for Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR). 
CAGR smooths out ﬂuctuations and provides an average annual growth rate that 
accounts for compounding. For example, if you grow from $10M in ARR to 
$100M in ARR in 5 years, it would equate to a CAGR of 58.5%. 
CAGR can be especially informative for late stage investors as it serves    
as a reliable indicator of the appetite of the market for the product. In this 
case, a CAGR of 58.5% over 5 years is a fantastic growth rate that many 
investors would ﬁnd attractive. In short, use CAGR for investor relations 
and benchmarking, providing a smooth annual growth rate ideal for 
comparing performance over several years. On the other hand, CMGR is 
more suited for short-term, internal business analysis, offering insights into 
monthly trends and aiding in running the business on a day-to-day basis.

Monthly Compound Growth Rate (MCGR)
Measuring growth in monthly recurring revenue (MRR) can be a challenge as 
month-over-month growth rates can be inconsistent. A more reliable metric to 
use is the Compound Monthly Growth Rate (CMGR), as David Spitz, Founder of 
BenchSights, suggests. CMGR provides a smoothed, average rate of growth over 
multiple months. For instance, if you started the year at $10M IN ARR and ended 
it at $20M in ARR, this method would yield a CMGR of 5.95%

In a recurring revenue business, especially one experiencing rapid growth, 
the growth rate is calculated as the increase in revenue over a period 
relative to the revenue at the start of that period. As the business grows 
and the base revenue (the denominator in this calculation) becomes larger, 
maintaining the same growth rate becomes more challenging. This is 
where the denominator effect comes into play. It works as follows:
● As the recurring revenue business grows, its base revenue—the 
denominator in the growth rate calculation—becomes larger. This 
large base can be from an expanding customer base, increased 
subscription fees, or additional services.
● With a larger denominator, the same absolute increase in revenue 
represents a smaller percentage of growth than before. For 
example, adding $1 million in revenue to a total of $5 million is a 
20% increase, but adding the same $1 million to a $50 million 
total is only a 2% increase.
● This leads to a natural decline in the growth rate over time, even if 
the business adds the same or even greater absolute revenue 
each year. As a result, despite strong performance, the growth 
appears to stall.
● The effect is more pronounced in rapidly growing businesses 
because they quickly accumulate a substantial revenue base. As 
the company scales, the sheer volume of revenue required to 
sustain high percentage growth increases, making it a more 
challenging target to achieve.
● Businesses with recurring revenue need to manage stakeholder 
expectations regarding growth rates. Stakeholders should 
understand that percentage growth rates will naturally decline as 
the business scales, even as absolute growth remains strong.
The denominator effect is a mathematical reality even for the healthiest of 
businesses, rather than an indicator of deteriorating performance.

The Denominator Effect and its Impact on SaaS Growth Rates
The denominator effect is a normal mathematical phenomena that causes a 
gradual decline of growth rate as the business grows. 
Let's say the total revenue in Year 5 was $100 million, and in Year 6 $10M in 
revenue is added. According to Formula 9.1, this would represent a 10% annual 
growth rate. Now, if in the next year, the same team delivers the same results, and 
it increases revenue once again by $10M to $120 million, the growth rate naturally 
drops from 10% to 8.3%. The untrained eye may perceive that growth is stalling. 
This misunderstanding is crucial for companies in a mature growth stage, who 
ﬁnd that new revenue growth doesn't have the same dramatic impact on overall 
revenue as it did in earlier years. The origins and characteristics of this are 
explained in more detail in Annex B.
Growth Rate Terms
There are different growth rate ranges each with their own popularized name 
(see Table 9.2) such as normal growth, rapid growth, and hypergrowth. All of 
these are  commonly seen in B2B companies. The coolest term of all, 
Blitzscaling, is reserved for the rarest of success stories. Blitzscaling requires a 
large accessible market. It can be found in the consumer and professional user 
space. Recent examples include Shopify and OpenAI.

The term Blitzscaling was popularized by Reid Hoffman, co-founder of 
LinkedIn, and Chris Yeh in their book Blitzscaling: The Lightning-Fast Path 
to Building Massively Valuable Companies. Blitzscaling is best applied 
when being the ﬁrst to scale can lead to a dominant market position that 
competitors ﬁnd diﬃcult to challenge. The strategy involves growing at a 
breakneck pace and quickly capturing market share. Blitzscaling causes 
excessive spending on marketing and sales, rapid hiring, aggressive 
investment in product development, and scaling operations at a pace 
many would consider reckless. The approach exploits network effects at 
the expense of short-term proﬁtability, requiring signiﬁcant investments 
and calculated risks to achieve massive growth. This strategy can lead to 
immense success, as seen in companies like Spotify, Uber, and Airbnb, but 
it carries substantial risks, including potential ﬁnancial collapse.

9.1.3 Growth Stages
Growth stages refer to the different phases of a company's development,     
each characterized by speciﬁc ﬁnancial, operational, and market milestones. 
Understanding the difference between these stages is crucial as they reﬂect 
investment risks and opportunities. Table 9.3 describes the most common 
growth stages, the funding round that fuels them, their average duration, their 
revenue ranges, and their growth rates.
Growth Stage Funding Round Revenue (ARR) Length Growth Rate
Seed Angel Up to $1M 1 to 2 years Achieve $1M
Startup A, B Up to $10M 2 to 4 years 100% to 200%
Scaleup C, D, (E) Up to $300M 3 to 6 years 60% to 100%
Grownup IPO+ Beyond $300M 2 to 4 years 10% to 60%
Enterprise Public Beyond $10B Over 20 years  <10%

Mapping these growth stages to the S-curve illustrates the typical lifecycle of a 
venture-funded company, from seed funding to becoming a successful public 
company (see Figure 9.3). This means that Startups, Scaleups, Grownups, and 
Enterprises are all on the same trajectory. Every Startup wants to become into a 
Scaleup, each Scaleup aims to go public, and every Grownup endeavors to 
become highly proﬁtable. Note that not all venture funded companies may wish 
to pursue an IPO, with some choosing alternative exit strategies. Regardless 
each company's growth phase can be pinpointed on the S-curve, based on time 
and revenue, aligning with a distinct growth stage.

The Inﬂection Point
The inﬂection point is a pivotal moment that signiﬁes that the direction of 
growth is shifting. It serves as an early indicator providing the leadership team 
with a crucial decision: whether to continue pursuing growth, which often 
requires further investments such as expanding the market and user base, or to 
focus on achieving proﬁtability, where the emphasis is on optimizing operations 
and revenue.

Along this journey, an IPO can serve as a transformative event, bringing a new 
wave of capital that the company can utilize to consolidate its market position. 
This may involve strategic moves such as acquiring complementary 
businesses to expand the total available market, thereby extending the upward 
trajectory of the S-curve and shifting the inﬂection point further into the future. 
An example of this is Uber, which leveraged its existing infrastructure to launch 
UberEats and subsequently acquired Postmates. This exempliﬁes how 
expansions serve to broaden the market and defer the inﬂection point.
Growth Trends
Growth trends are governed by 2 important effects:
● The Compound Effect (see page 324 for a description): In a recurring 
revenue business, future revenues are inﬂuenced by past revenues. 
This effect is grounded in 'The Fundamentals of Growth,' (see Section 
2.2), in which we outline that Growth from Retention is the dominant 
contributor of the total annual revenue each month, often exceeding 
90%. Consequently, the bulk of future revenues is derived from the 
revenue generated in previous years. Companies with revenues 
spanning multiple years have woven a growth trend into each cohort 
of customers progressively enhancing predictability over time.
● The Denominator Effect (see page 331 for a description): This effect 
occurs in rapidly growing businesses where, as the base revenue 
increases, each addition to revenue represents a smaller percentage 
of growth. This leads to a natural decline in growth rates over time, 
despite strong absolute revenue growth.
The combination of these 2 growth effects, when applied to the S-curve, form 
the basis of growth trends. They also explain why investors are more attracted 
to subscription-based businesses compared to those that rely on ownership or 
consumption for revenue. Understanding and using these effects is essential 
for businesses aiming for steady growth and investor trust.

The T2D3 Growth Trend
In 2015, in the middle of the Golden Era of SaaS, Neeraj Agrawal of Battery 
Ventures observed that successful companies followed a similar trajectory 
each time. He observed that once a Startup exceeds $1M in revenue, they 
quickly triple that revenue, then triple it again, followed by doubling, then 
doubling, and doubling again. In other words, Triple 2 times and Double 3 
times, or T2D3. At the end of T2D3 startups ended up in close proximity to 
$100M in revenue, and with the going valuations at the time, they would 
achieve unicorn status. Here’s how that works out:
● Start: $.   1.4M
● Year 1: $.   4.2M
● Year 2: $  12.6M
● Year 3: $  25.2M
● Year 4: $  50.4M
● Year 5: $100.8M
A real life of this example is depicted in Figure 9.4.

C H A P T E R   0 9   |   G R O W T H   M O D E L 321
After the T2D3 growth pattern, startups continue to grow, but their growth rate 
gradually declines. In the following years, they ﬁrst trend toward hypergrowth 
(40%) and then rapid growth (20%). During this evolution, the growth rate 
naturally declines. With it, the importance of growth as a metric for valuation 
decreases, and proﬁt starts to play a more signiﬁcant role. This leads to the Rule 
of 40 as an important factor for companies that surpassed $100M in ARR. 
Historically, companies following a known growth trajectory secured substantial 
funding rounds at high valuations. This is because such predictability indicates 
that these companies have successfully met the needs of their target market.
● Statement: While T2D3 serves as a concise representation of a 
correlation in the growth trend, the combination of the Compound 
Effect, the Denominator Effect, and the S-Curve as a growth pattern 
reﬂects the causal nature of growth, rooted in a mathematical 
foundation.
● Condition: The predictability of revenue growth relies on the maturity 
of the processes that have yielded the results it is based on.
● Let’s translate: Each GTM motion functions like a sub-system, 
essentially its own revenue production line. For example, consider a 
low touch inbound GTM motion as its own sub-system. The maturity 
of the processes behind this GTM motion reﬂects the stability of the 
data and, consequently, its predictability. It usually takes a certain 
volume of business, often around $8M in ARR, for a process to 
mature. By aggregating the predictions of all mature sub-systems, 
we can determine the performance of the entire system, which is 
measured in ARR.
In other words, the maturity of the GTM processes within your organization 
signiﬁcantly inﬂuences your growth (and valuation), often more than most 
leadership teams realize. And, it is remarkable how, over several years, the 
company's growth pattern will reﬂect all the obscure processes in a company, 
think of the hiring process, the onboarding process, the process to integrate new 
tools, launch a new campaign, and so on.

Circumstances Causing Growth to Deviate from the Growth Trend
The growth trajectory of a company can signiﬁcantly deviate from the 
established growth trend under speciﬁc circumstances. These circumstances 
may include:
Internal Factors, such as strategic moves taken by companies to introduce 
innovations, adapt to changing market conditions, or expand their product 
offerings in pursuit of accelerated growth.
● Launching a new product, as exempliﬁed by Apple's introduction of the 
iPhone, App Store, iPad, and later the iPhone.
● Changes in pricing and packaging strategies, such as Netﬂix introducing 
premium packages, as well as an Ad-supported model.
● Acquisition of a company with substantial revenue, akin to Facebook's 
acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp.
External Factors are those that go beyond a company's control, and they can 
have a substantial negative impact on its growth rate. These events are 
notoriously challenging to predict. Here are some examples:
● A major brand issues triggering cancel culture, resulting in user 
disassociation from the company and its products.
● Competitors disrupting the market with superior products at lower 
prices, illustrated by OpenAI's actions in December 2022.
● Economic events inﬂuencing macro behavior, such as the housing 
bubble and more recently the SaaS crash in early 2022. 
These "once-in-a-lifetime" external events have a much higher likelihood than the 
name suggests. The real challenge lies not in predicting "if" these events will 
occur, but rather "when," as they often are outcomes of the "boiling frog 
syndrome” in which substantial gains are made in time, often with the biggest 
gains occurring just before the bubble bursts and the market crashes.
These factors illustrate how various internal and external factors can lead to 
deviations from expected growth patterns.

Growth Funding Stages
A pattern emerges when we analyze data from services like Pitchbook and 
Crunchbase, along with performance metrics from respected partners across 
various VC and PE ﬁrms. According to this data acquired during the course of 
2021, the peak of the SaaS boom, the number of Startups that make it to the 
next stage decreases signiﬁcantly at each funding stage—approximately halving 
with each round. For example, in 2021 it took 45 companies that received an 
A-round to produce just one that went public (IPO) or was acquired. By late 2023, 
this ratio dwindled from 1:45 to 1:60. Since then, these metrics have only 
deteriorated. 
Growth funding stages, and the stage to stage success metrics.TABLE 9.4

27% will make it to Go To Market ﬁt B-round
14% become a Scaleup C-round Scaleup Stage
6% make it to $100M in ARR D-round
1% goes public IPO Grownup Stage
Having been involved with over a thousand Startups and Scaleups, it is apparent 
that these low success rates often stem from the same set of challenges. There 
is a name for them: revenue breakpoints. And they occur all along the S-curve. 
To be clear, Startups are expected to fail, and failure is an absolutely necessary 
part of the process. However, no company with a successful product should fail 
because they picked the wrong GTM model, launched too many GTM motions, 
hired a wrong executive, or had a bad year. Good news: these revenue 
breakpoints are easily identiﬁable, and by understanding their root causes, we 
believe it's possible to substantially improve success rates. In the following 
paragraph, we'll identify 12 revenue breakpoints and provide valuable insights on 
each to help you prepare for them.

Growth Model
When we put the all the components together we get the Growth Model:
● Growth Pattern: The S-Curve
● Growth Rate =
● Growth Stages: Startup, Scaleup, Grownup, and Enterprise
● Growth Trends: Triple, Double, Hypergrowth, and Rapid growth
● Growth Funding Stages: Startup, Scaleup, Grownup, and Enterprise
In a recurring revenue model built around a platform, such as a CRM or ERP 
system, progression along the S-curve is measured in terms of recurring revenue 
over time. However, in application-based businesses that cater to individual 
users, this progression can also be gauged by tracking the number of active 
users over time. In these businesses, Daily Active Users (DAU) and Monthly 
Active Users (MAU) become important metrics to monitor.

Growth Modeling as a Crucial Operational Tool
For companies on a rapid trajectory, understanding and applying growth 
modeling is not just advantageous—it's imperative. Let's break it down:
● A Foundation in Past Performance: A growth trend is based on the 
principle that past performance inﬂuences future performance, 
enabling companies to forecast future revenues using historical data.
● Effectiveness of GTM Motions: Data reﬂects the effectiveness of every 
part of a GTM motion. These GTM motions reﬂect an ecosystem, 
integrating a way of working that generates growth; this includes, 
among others, the tools used and all established processes, including 
critical ones like the hiring and onboarding process.
● The Sum of GTM Motions: The overall number reﬂects the sum of all 
GTM motions, each based on repeatable processes, which when 
combined provide predictable growth. 
● Human-Led Process: Processes that involve humans usually take a lot 
longer (1 to 2 years) to mature and deliver the expected results. 
● Investing in Growth : Rapid growth of a recurring revenue business 
necessitates investing in growth in advance as much as 1 or 2 years. In 
comparison, organic growth is more gradual; it depends on existing 
success for future expansion. Consequently, organic growth, while 
sustainable, progresses much slower, increasing the risk of missing the 
window of opportunity compared to a venture funded startup.
This tells us that the growth rate is not merely a metric for driving valuation but, 
more importantly, is a crucial operational tool. It guides an organization in 
planning and implementing the necessary means and methods for each GTM 
motion 12 to 18 months in advance. But all of this depends on the maturity of a 
business's processes, which is not inherently present even in some of the largest 
SaaS companies. This, in part, explains the lower success rates but also points 
to a clear direction for improvement. Using growth modeling as a framework, 
organizations can streamline and optimize their GTM motions, identify areas for 
improvement, and align their strategies for rapid growth.

REVENUE BREAKPOINTS
There is a series of revenue breakpoints along the S-curve. These breakpoints do 
not occur all at once, nor just once. They apply to each speciﬁc GTM motion, and 
at times they may have to be navigated multiple times as a company grows.
The ﬁrst 6 revenue breakpoints are:
● Breakpoint 1: Pricing and packaging (9.2.1)
● Breakpoint 2: Founder-led growth (9.2.2)
● Breakpoint 3: Data Model and structures (9.2.3)

Breakpoint 1: Pricing and Packaging 
Choosing the correct revenue model is essential, as it must align with your 
product, target market, and overall business strategy. As presented in Chapter 5, 
there are 3 different approaches to choose from: an ownership model, a 
subscription model, or a consumption-based model. But there is a lot more to it 
that companies need to get right:
● Keep Pricing Simple: Early on, you may dabble with a mix of the 3 models, 
such as having an additional piece of equipment sold based on 
an upfront fee, adding re-occurring support services like training, or 
even a consumption model for usage of some consumable.
While it's okay to experiment in the early days, having multiple mixed revenue 
models is not advisable. For example, it is a common mistake to keep a 
monthly pricing structure on the books just so "customers can try out the 
service for a couple of months." You don't want to carry that pricing and 
packaging structure to $100M in ARR.
● Business Model: Will you run the business based on monthly recurring 
revenue (MRR) or annual recurring revenue? This choice is independent of 
the pricing strategy; for example, you may sell annual contracts but still 
decide only to recognize revenue monthly.
● Refund Policy: Deﬁning refund policies is essential for customer satisfaction 
and indicates the business model's ﬂexibility. For example, what will your 
policy be if a customer wants a refund 5 months into a 12-month contract? 
Transparency will enhance trust and conﬁdence in your offering.
● Revenue Recognition for Multi-Year Contracts: Consider how you'll handle 
2- to 3-year contracts. Will you recognize the entire booking up front, or will 
you recognize only the annual payment? This decision affects your ﬁnancial 
reporting and can affect business health and growth perceptions.
These are just a few topics that illustrate that once you pick the monetization 
strategy, you still have to get the pricing and packaging right.

C H A P T E R   0 9   |   G R O W T H   M O D E L
By considering the multifaceted aspects of pricing, payment, and refund policies, 
you can create a robust revenue model that supports your growth while 
maintaining trust and transparency with your customers. Price Intelligently, a 
company specialized in the industry, says it best: “A well-oiled pricing strategy is 
7.5x more effective at generating growth than acquisition strategies alone. Yet 
monetization is too often an afterthought.”
Breakpoint 2: Leveraging Founder-Led Growth
Founder-driven refers to the founder personally getting involved in operational 
processes. For example, in the early stages, there is often a founder-led sales 
effort in which the founder plays a crucial role in closing deals. Considering the 
challenges with outbound sales, having the founder involved will signiﬁcantly 
impact lead generation and drive instant success, even fostering a unique trust 
with customers.
Founder-driven engagement can create a more personalized experience and 
demonstrate the company's responsiveness, resulting in higher commitment 
and quicker decision-making. Although founder-led sales motions are 
well-known, they are not limited to sales. For instance, Zoom's founder, Eric 
Yuan, used social media to interact directly with customers, identify and solve 
software bugs, and showcase a responsive and hands-on approach. This 
reﬂects a Founder-Led Customer Service motion.
Founder-driven strategies offer many advantages, but they also come with 
drawbacks. They can lead to an over-reliance on the founder, making it 
challenging to scale the business later. The founder may bypass existing 
processes, resulting in inconsistencies that can become counterproductive.
Founder-Driven Strategies to Scale Growth
Organizations should develop a strategy that allows the founder to gradually 
reduce direct involvement while ensuring the company matures without losing 
its innovative spirit. As the company grows, the founder's role must evolve from 
working with customers to transferring their knowledge to the operational staff. 
To harness the distinctive qualities of a founder, consider

implementing a range of strategies that gradually shift the founder's role from 
direct operational involvement to other impactful avenues. Here are some 
strategies to consider:
● Customer Advisory Board: Cultivate strong relationships with customers 
and gather valuable product feedback.
● Team Training: Convey the stories behind the fundamental elements that 
led to creating the solution in order to empower the team.
● Speaker Circuit: Engage in public speaking engagements to enhance 
brand visibility and introduce groundbreaking developments.
● Thought Leadership: Share expertise and insights through publications, 
blogs, and other channels.
● Research and Development: Founders with a penchant for innovation 
may ﬁnd leading the R&D department as a natural outlet.
● Open New Markets: Entrepreneurial-minded founders can contribute to 
expanding into new geographic or demographic markets.
These initiatives can help leverage the energy, innovation, and customer 
connection that often accompany this one-of-a-kind personality.
Breakpoint 3: Establishing the Right Data Model and Structure
Along the journey from $1M to $1B in revenue, achieving and maintaining
growth requires the investment of tens to hundreds of millions of dollars into
programs that are proven to create growth. This funding often must be spent
within a relatively short time frame on expensive marketing campaigns and
hiring premium talent, some of whom may have long-term contracts. Such
signiﬁcant investments should not be based on opinion but on reliable data 
that can guide whether further spending will achieve the intended results. 
In almost all companies, tensions between marketing and sales functions will 
develop sooner rather than later. Even sales and customer success functions 
can fall victim to miscommunication, especially concerning customers who 
churn too early. A sign of trouble is when executive meetings include questions 
about data validity, such as, “where did you get that data from?”

FIGURE 9.7
With the high turnover of leadership roles, newly hired executives come and go, 
and each one will question the data model and make changes within their 
departments. Without a standardized data model and structure, the data model 
and all associated historical data will soon be in disarray. On the other hand, 
mapping to a standardized data model with a well-deﬁned structure early on will 
help you benchmark against yourself over the years. It will increase insights and, 
most importantly, enable organizations to make crucial data-driven decisions 
when needed the most.
The Importance of a Uniﬁed Data Approach
Establishing a consistent Data Model, like the Bowtie model discussed in 
Chapter 6, is crucial for tracking the entire customer journey. This can be a 
challenging task for companies that lack the resources and expertise. However, 
delaying this only makes it more complicated down the line. This isn't just about 
sidestepping interdepartmental conﬂicts; it's a strategic investment in your 
company's long-term success, setting a clear, aligned course for data-driven 
decision-making and (more) predictable growth.

The Danger of an Ill-Deﬁned Data Model
This problem often arises when a company allows its marketing and sales 
leaders to choose their data model and structure despite not being experts in 
these areas. This inexperience will result in an ill-deﬁned lead-to-deal data model 
with varying deﬁnitions for leads and opportunities across different teams.

Breakpoint 4: The GTM Model
What's essential to understand is that a GTM approach serves as a framework 
for organizing all customer-facing roles. A company's overall GTM approach can 
be divided into different GTM motions, each operating as a standalone business. 
An organization must be deliberate in selecting the correct GTM motion for the 
task and align its GTM efforts accordingly with the chosen motions. 
Figure 9.8 illustrates the various GTM motions. This topic is so important that 
we've dedicated an entire chapter to it (Chapter 10).

It is expected to get the ﬁrst GTM motion right; it often happens organically, and 
with only one GTM motion, all the resources naturally align. However, soon 
enough, new GTM motions are launched, leading to all kinds of issues. The most 
common ones are selecting the wrong GTM motion or executing the correct 
GTM motion poorly. Many things can trigger the launch of an additional GTM 
motion, and organizations must make a deliberate choice each time. When left 
unchecked, it is not uncommon for a company with $250M in revenue to have 
over 20 GTM motions, each with its own requirements.

Here are some examples that may cause the launch of a new GTM motion:
● Opening a New Market Segment: Changing a GTM motion can open a 
new market segment. For instance, if you use a PLG solution to sell to 
professional users, and you want to enter a new market like Enterprise, 
you will need to use a new GTM motion, e.g., a high-touch GTM motion.
● Launching a New Product: A new product may necessitate revisiting the 
GTM motion altogether, as it might target a different price point or buyer or 
involve other buying processes and criteria.
● Changing the Pricing Model: Switching from monthly to annual contracts 
can impact proﬁts, possibly making the chosen GTM motion too costly.
● Opening a New Vertical Market: For example, selling a remote 
communication solution to technology companies and targeting 
pharmaceutical companies requires understanding the differences 
between these industries.
● Opening a New Region: Regulations regarding prospective buyers        
may vary by region. Some GTM motions, such as those focused on 
volume-based emails or calls, might be restricted in certain countries    
due to privacy laws.
● Mergers and Acquisitions: This less common but highly complicated 
scenario requires careful consideration of the implications of merging 
different GTM motions.
Selecting, launching, and operating the right GTM motions is not a luxury; it is 
fundamental to establishing scalable and sustainable growth. 
The Importance of Selecting the Right GTM Model
Choosing the correct GTM model is not a one-time decision but an ongoing 
process that adapts to market changes. Mistakes can be costly, resulting in 
tangible expenses and missed opportunities, whereas the right choices lay the 
foundation for success. By thoughtfully considering and implementing the most 
effective GTM motions, a company can remain aligned with customer needs and 
business objectives, ensuring sustainable growth.

LinkedIn's Customer-Centric Approach to Product Launch
A few years ago, I was fortunate to have a front-row seat as LinkedIn launched a 
new solution. Instead of developing a product in secret and then unveiling it with 
fanfare, they assembled a Customer Advisory Board (CAB). From the beginning, 
they used data to demonstrate the innovative product's necessity to the CAB. 
They kept the CAB informed through quarterly product demonstrations and 
engaged in discussions about pricing, packaging, and how to address 
integration issues. Several months before the oﬃcial launch, they initiated an 
education program for the marketing and sales teams, which included 
publishing articles, participating in events, and providing enablement materials. 
This two-year process enabled LinkedIn to create an excellent product with 
customer involvement, achieve an almost immediate GTM ﬁt, and gain customer 
advocates for the newly launched product.

Launching a new GTM motion requires stepping through the process. You can't 
start selling to the Enterprise by promoting an SMB seller and hiring a few 'big

It entails re-establishing PMF (pricing and packaging) and GTM Fit (new 
processes). This means navigating the revenue breakpoints all over again, albeit 
at an accelerated pace.

Breakpoint 5: Establishing a Repeatable Process
Scalability hinges on the ability to repeat a process reliably. A repeatable 
process is a set of activities consistently executed to achieve consistent 
results. When we implement such processes, we inherently create Scalability. 
On the ﬂip side, the absence of a structured process makes Scalability 
elusive. Without a foundation to build upon, the only options are to hire more 
exceptional individuals or boost lead generation. The telltale sign of an 
unscalable approach is ﬂuctuating results despite increased investments. It 
stems from a long-standing growth-at-all-costs mindset that prioritizes just 
doing more without a well-deﬁned process.
In the absence of processes, organizations become heavily reliant on the abilities 
of individuals within the company, a term known in the sports world as 'Hero ball.' 
While it may work on a small scale, such as in a startup, on a larger scale, it leads 
to unpredictable revenue growth. This unpredictability leaves the organization 
ill-equipped to meet growing demands, resulting in a decline in the growth rate 
and prematurely leveling the S-curve. When growth falters, it initiates a chain 
reaction: ﬁrstly, the sales leader is replaced, followed by a down round that 
penalizes the executives, and ultimately, a change in CEO. However, the most 
consequential issue is the delay in achieving GTM Fit, which causes the entire 
venture to miss its window of opportunity.
9.2.5
The absence of a repeatable process leads to a decline in the growth rate, a delay in 
GTM ﬁt, and prematurely plateaus the revenue. This carries signiﬁcant consequences.

Creating Scalable Growth Through Repeatable Processes
Scalable growth is attainable through establishing effective and repeatable 
processes within sales and across all functions within a GTM motion. Once a 
process has proven to work again and again, organizations can utilize funding, 
such as a C-round, to replicate what works and expedite their growth. It's not 
uncommon for companies to secure C-round funding even when they have only 
implemented a limited number of processes. However, this landscape is 
expected to evolve in the coming years as Revenue Architecture becomes 
increasingly prevalent in SaaS companies.
The growth rate represents the culmination of revenue generated through 
various GTM motions, where each GTM motion functions as a sub-system 
within the larger organization. The eﬃciency and effectiveness of each GTM 
motion are tightly linked to the maturity of its processes. Furthermore, the larger 
organization is a system itself, with its own unique set of processes, such as the 
hiring process. All these processes must function seamlessly, like a well-oiled 
machine, for sustainable growth. Therefore, successful GTM teams must ﬁnd a 
way to prioritize nurturing and reﬁning their processes while maintaining the 
agility and innovation associated with startups.

Breakpoint 6: A Growth Formula and Unit Economics
A Growth Formula is a mathematical representation of a scalable and proven 
process for each GTM motion. It clearly outlines the necessary resources and 
interconnectedness within each GTM motion required to achieve the desired 
growth. A Growth Formula can extract insights related to unit economics, 
providing a quantiﬁable foundation for informed decision-making to scale 
revenues. Recognizing its pivotal role, we have dedicated an entire section to the 
Growth Formula and unit economics (Section 7.2). Establishing a Growth 
Formula for your GTM motion is the pinnacle of achieving GTM ﬁt and hinges on 
having a repeatable and scalable process in place.

A Growth Formula functions as a roadmap for scaling revenue, guiding crucial 
aspects of the business, including lead generation targets, monthly sales quotas, 
and expansion revenue goals. Organizations must develop a Growth Formula for 
each GTM motion and continually reﬁne these formulas to adapt to changing 
conditions. Since the total revenue is the sum of all GTM motions, combining 
Growth Formulas allows an organization to model growth.

Unlocking the Power of Growth Formulas
It's important to note that the Growth Formula doesn't incorporate time or cost 
elements. Instead, it straightforwardly conveys that "If you provide this amount 
of leads to this system, you can anticipate a corresponding amount of revenue 
from the system over its lifetime." In this context, the system encompasses all 
GTM-related efforts, underscoring that growth stems from a revenue factory 
managed by the GTM team. As an example, consider a basic Growth Formula 
for the Low Touch GTM motion presented in Tables 7.5 and 7.6:
Securing one win requires 253 leads, typically sold at an average price of 
$18,408, factoring in a 23% discount. Over a 5-year horizon, this results in 
$106,909, considering an average NRR of 107% per year.
337
The Revenue Model lays the foundation for the subscription services 
pricing and packaging (Breakpoint 1). Maintaining a clear separation 
between non-recurring revenue products and services versus recurring 
revenue is crucial. The organization must embrace a process-centric 
approach while effectively using superstars like Founders (Breakpoint 2). 
Recurring revenue growth is the sum of the growth from acquisition, 
retention, and expansion. 
A robust data model covering all 3 growth components is needed 
(Breakpoint 3). Marketing, sales, and customer success functions must 
be consolidated into a uniﬁed GTM motion (Breakpoint 4). A repeatable 
process for each GTM motion ensures a consistent and effective output 
(Breakpoint 5). 
Once the process yields repeatable and predictable results, it is translated 
into a Growth Formula for each GTM motion (Breakpoint 6). The Growth 
Formula serves as a formulaic representation of the process's 
performance, guiding organizations on what needs to be done to achieve 
their desired growth.

The Next Six Breakpoints On The Way To $1B In Revenue
As we traverse the S-curve a fresh set of challenges emerges. The pace 
quickens, room for error shrinks, and the consequences of misjudgments 
swell. Warren Buffett famously said, “Only when the tide goes out do you 
discover who's been swimming naked.” Just as the tide exposes what's hidden 
beneath the surface, the next set of Revenue Breakpoints reveal the 
preparedness of organizations behind their numbers, and what we have

Breakpoint 7: Scalability (Velocity)
One of the common misconceptions about market leadership is that it goes to 
the ﬁrst player on the scene. However, a closer look reveals that many of today's 
market leaders weren't necessarily the ﬁrst to start but rather the ﬁrst to scale. 
Even a company as dominant as LinkedIn faced competitors in its early days, 
with some of them, like Plaxo, offering arguably better solutions at the time. The 
key lesson here is that organizations that carefully select their GTM motions, 
even if it means having fewer of them, often achieve faster scaling. To illustrate 
this concept, let's dive into a story featuring 2 direct SaaS competitors, each 
with a distinct GTM motion: ACME and NewCo.
ACME vs. NewCo: Two Competing GTM Strategies
In 2015, ACME burst onto the scene and quickly garnered industry attention, 
leading to a signiﬁcant Series A funding round. The GTM team embarked on a 
journey of experimentation with various GTM motions. Given the product 
team's familiarity with a product-led growth approach, they leaned into it. 
Simultaneously, the newly recruited sales team heavily focused on inside 
sales but ventured into High Touch sales roles, albeit without a complete 
understanding of the implications. Instead of narrowing its focus following the 
Series A funding, ACME continued to explore multiple avenues, primarily due 
to the challenges associated with decision-making. As time passed, they 
found themselves with 3 distinct GTM motions in play:
● GTM Motion 1/High Touch: Field sales motion that contributes $5M in ARR
● GTM Motion 2/Low Touch: Inside sales motion that contributes $3M in ARR
● GTM Motion 3/No Touch: PLG motion contributes $2M in ARR
ACME's journey to reach $10M in revenue took several years. In contrast, 
NewCo entered the market almost 2 years later, in late 2016, beneﬁting from 
the market education already provided by ACME. Despite having less funding, 
NewCo strategically concentrated its resources on a single GTM motion. The 
leadership team, with extensive Enterprise experience, decided to build their 
entire GTM strategy around the Enterprise/High Touch motion.

Analyzing the ACME GTM Strategy
When ACME reached $10 million in revenue, it managed 3 distinct GTM motions 
that were somewhat disconnected. Their high-touch GTM motion lacked a 
well-established repeatable process, the medium-touch GTM motion faced 
challenges with insuﬃcient lead volume, and the no-touch GTM motion had 
abundant leads but was still grappling with ﬁnding the optimal pricing and 
packaging. None of ACME's 3 GTM motions were well-prepared for scaling. 
ACME's rapid growth to $10 million garnered much attention and soon led to a 
successful $25 million funding round. With this infusion of new capital came the 
mandate to accelerate growth. So unsurprisingly, ACME allocated the funding to 
all 3 GTM motions, thereby investing in multiple marketing campaigns, 
expanding all 3 teams, adopting different cutting-edge tools for each GTM 
motion, and enlisting the support of various independent consultants to 
orchestrate this large-scale effort.

high velocity. Velocity is the determining factor in achieving market leadership.

Analyzing the NewCo GTM Strategy
NewCo's high-touch GTM approach may have resulted in fewer deals, but it 
brought in signiﬁcantly larger and more proﬁtable contracts. Although NewCo 
had started almost 2 years later, by choosing to focus on one GTM, NewCo 
achieved $10 million in revenue shortly after ACME did. NewCo's higher velocity 
did not go unnoticed, and it attracted a $35 million funding round, enabling it to 
scale its proven GTM motion. 
In contrast to ACME, NewCo allocate 3 times the resources to a single, more 
mature GTM motion, allowing them to replicate their successful strategy. The 
outcome was that they scaled much faster, as depicted in Figure 9.14. This 
illustrates that the key is not who enters the market ﬁrst but who scales ﬁrst.
Scalability is Growth as a Function of Velocity 
The ACME/NewCo scenario is not an isolated case. Take HubSpot, for instance, 
which succeeded through a low-touch GTM motion focused on producing 
valuable content and educating people about inbound marketing, targeting the 
VSB/SMB market. The alignment between the product it sells and the GTM 
motion it employs is vital here. Similarly, Slack adopted a no-touch GTM motion, 
aiming at tech-savvy engineering teams needing collaboration. Using a PLG 
model, Slack enables organizations to experience the product directly, driving 
adoption. Slack's focus on delivering an exceptional user experience, coupled 
with customer-friendly pricing, packaging, and seamless integration with other 
tools, ensures its GTM motion perfectly harmonizes with its product, 
contributing to its rapid growth.
Both examples illustrate that deploying a GTM strategy with a motion aligned to 
the product catalyzes high-velocity growth. This velocity encompasses not only 
the rate of growth but also its direction, with the latter being contingent upon the 
correct GTM motion. This underscores the importance of prioritizing scalability 
and achieving growth velocity rather than simply being ﬁrst to market as the 
foundation of early success.

Breakpoint 8: Becoming Sustainable (Cost of Growth)
During an economic downturn, all metrics across all GTM functions are 
impacted at the same time. There will be fewer leads, conversion rates will 
be lower, discounts will go up, customers will churn, and fewer customers 
will expand. As this occurs, the same amount of resources suddenly brings 
in much less revenue, dramatically increasing customer acquisition cost and the 
CTS. We learned about the impact of marginal changes in Section 7.1.4; a 
summarized version of this data can be found below (see Table 9.5).

Use Case Example 
In this example, we'll use the data from Table 9.5 to analyze a Low Touch GTM 
motion. In this scenario, a Sales Development Representative (SDR) generates 
Marketing Qualiﬁed Leads (MQLs) and converts them into Sales Qualiﬁed Leads 
(SQLs), while the Account Executive (AE) closes deals. The SDR earns 
$80,000/year, the AE earns $140,000/year, and they are selling a platform 
software priced at $20,000.
First Quarter (Q1) Analysis:
In Q1, the acquisition system's run-rate is as follows: 2.3 deals/month, 
generating $41,310/month, which adds up to $495,720 in ARR per year.

annual revenue of $229,133. Due to variable compensation, the acquisition 
cost decreases to $164,409 as shown in Table 9.7. However, the revenue 
experiences a steeper decline from $495,720 to $229,133. 
In summary, as revenue declined, the acquisition cost as a percentage of 
revenue increased signiﬁcantly.

It costs approximately $100 in campaign costs to generate one MQL. In this 
example, the total customer acquisition cost is $225,058 against an ARR of 
$495,720, which means 45% of the ARR was spent on acquisition.

The Challenge of Rising Costs in GTM
The challenge goes beyond the inevitable rise in costs; it's rooted in the lack of 
understanding regarding the cost dynamics of a GTM motion and its trajectory. 
In business models with narrow proﬁt margins, the dramatic shift we've 
illustrated highlights a scenario where costs don't decrease in proportion to 
revenue. This reveals an underlying ineﬃciency that may not be immediately 
evident but has signiﬁcant implications. This dynamic, where declining revenue 
results in a higher proportion of costs, even as absolute costs decrease, 
exempliﬁes what we mean by "unsustainable."
If left unaddressed, this situation can severely impact a company's ﬁnancial 
health and stability. In today's evolving business environment, control and 
Sustainability aren't merely desires; they're essential. This signiﬁes a departure 
from past practices and guides us toward a future where growth is pursued 
scientiﬁcally and responsibly. 
GTM teams should not only assess the Scalability of each GTM motion 
using the Growth Formula but also closely monitor the cost of each GTM 
motion as a percentage of generated revenue. Looking ahead, we 
recommend that GTM teams track these metrics for each GTM motion.on 
a monthly basis. Thereby evaluating Scalability and Sustainability.
This journey aligns us with a path that numerous other disciplines have 
successfully followed before us—a path marked by quality control, 
data-driven decision-making, continuous improvement, and iterative, 
incremental progress. All of these achievements are made possible 
through collaboration and teamwork.
What we recommend here is not new, and it  may not be ﬂawless, but 
every journey must begin somewhere, and this is where we begin.

Breakpoint 9: Increasing Productivity
As a company grows, it becomes increasingly dependent on the productivity of 
its GTM crew. We have observed that productivity will vary signiﬁcantly from 
person to person. For instance, it's not uncommon for top sellers to consistently 
exceed 100% of their goals, while lower performers often struggle to achieve 
even half of their objectives. In customer success, for example, the best reps 
manage a book of business twice the size of their lower-performing peers. This 
growing disparity between top and bottom performers puts pressure on 
companies to improve productivity.
In 2023, our ﬁndings revealed 3 distinct cohorts with varying levels of 
productivity:
● The Normal Group: This group consisted of 32% of all Go-To-Market reps 
who consistently performed at a normal level. Within this 'normal' group, only 
4.4% consistently exceeded their goals, falling short of the 20% benchmark 
commonly observed in B2B sales. It's worth noting that several factors 
contribute to this, primarily the nature of SaaS, which involves a higher 
volume of deals based on standardized products and ﬁxed pricing, making it 
less reliant on superstar reps.
● The Swing Group: This group represents individuals who consistently 
achieve between 50% and 80% of their goals, typically constituting about 
40% of the team. Often referred to as the ‘swing group,’ they possess the 
most signiﬁcant potential to assist organizations in achieving their 
objectives.
● The Bottom Group: This cohort comprises individuals who consistently 
operate below 50%. Despite the company's investment in these reps, they 
consistently fall short of expectations and are found to do the minimum 
amount of work to stay in the job. As of early 2024, this underperforming 
group represents approximately 28% of the organization, marking an 
increase from the bottom 10% we have grown accustomed to.

## Page 346

C H A P T E R   0 9   |   G R O W T H   M O D E L
The key revelation here is that the Normal Group, representing 32%, outperforms 
the other groups by a factor of 1.53x in productivity. For example, sellers in the 
Normal Group, with the same number of leads, generate 1.53x more revenue. 
The primary distinction causing this gap can be attributed to the level of 
discipline in executing proven processes. This also implies that 68% of the GTM 
crew was not effectively executing these processes. This group has grown so 
large that it signiﬁcantly lowered the 'average,' which is why we refer to 'normal' 
performance levels. It highlights the potential to increase revenue at a lower 
costs, thereby boosting productivity.
Key Steps to Boost Productivity
In this discussion, we will focus on productivity related to 'on-task' performance. 
On-task performance reﬂects the ability of a GTM rep to stay focused and 
productive while working on speciﬁc tasks. When reps exhibit on-task 
performance, they work eﬃciently, maintain consistency in achieving their goals, 
and execute proven processes effectively. This level of performance directly 
attributes to revenue generation, enabling them to achieve more with the same 
resources. In essence, on-task performance is the driving force behind increased 
productivity, consistency, and revenue growth. There are 4 actions that will 
increase on-task performance:
● Action 1: Shorten the Ramp-Up Time, not just during onboarding but 
whenever they transition to new tasks and their roles change.
● Action 2: Retain Productive GTM Reps Longer: Encourage productive GTM 
reps to stay with the organization.
● Action 3: Enhance a GTM Rep’s On-Task Performance through skill 
training and disciplined execution of proven processes.
● Action 4: Optimize Headcount: Many organizations have traditionally 
focused on growth through hiring. However, as we explored in the 
Fundamentals (Section 4.3), this approach can be counterproductive. 
Historically, organizations end up hiring way more people than necessary. In 
such cases, lowering headcount can lead to an increase in productivity.
Next we will delve deeper into each of these steps.

Shorten the Ramp with Modern Training Techniques
Many forward-thinking organizations are embracing modern training techniques 
to expedite the onboarding process. 
● One common trend is establishing internal academies that blend on-demand 
and live training sessions, reducing reliance on external trainers. However, 
these academies are not limited to teaching tool stacks or HR policies; they 
aim to bridge the critical gap in soft skills necessary for effective execution, a 
need applicable across all GTM roles.
● Another valuable approach is leveraging call recordings. Studies have 
revealed that sales representatives engaging with customer conversations, 
especially during discovery calls and demos, tend to onboard more swiftly. 
Creating a comprehensive call library can signiﬁcantly scale up the 
effectiveness of this practice.
Peer-based coaching is another indispensable strategy. New hires are paired 
with seasoned team members, fostering a close working relationship over 3 to 6 
months. This hands-on mentoring approach facilitates rapid skill acquisition and 
integration within the team.

The shrinking productivity window of a modern employee reﬂects the effects of changing

a lack of skill training, overdependence on tools, and a shortage of managers who are to 
act as coaches.

Incorporating artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) into training programs is an emerging 
trend. AI-driven platforms offer personalized training paths, identifying each 
contributor's needs and improvement areas. They also provide simulated calls 
and emails for practical training, enhancing the onboarding experience. By 
implementing these modern training techniques, organizations can streamline 
the ramping-up process and equip their teams with the skills needed for success 
in the competitive business landscape.
Retain Productive GTM Reps Longer
To enhance employee retention and productivity, cultivating an accountability 
culture is paramount. This culture shift involves a forward-looking approach to 
talent retention, emphasizing continuous learning and development as key 
drivers of success.
● Retaining top-performing employees is a pivotal aspect of this strategy. 
By creating a work environment that encourages ongoing growth and 
improvement, organizations can attract and keep their most valuable 
team members engaged and committed.
● Another crucial element is the strategic utilization of employees' 
strengths. Identifying top performers' unique talents and capabilities 
and leveraging them within the team can lead to increased productivity 
and overall team success.
● In addition, progressive organizations are increasingly adopting the 
practice of promoting from within. By establishing in-house academies 
and development programs designed to nurture and elevate their star 
employees, these organizations ensure that their talent pipeline remains 
robust and that future leaders are cultivated.
By fostering an accountability culture that values continuous learning, 
recognizes individual strengths, and invests in internal talent development, 
organizations can retain their top-performing employees and ensure sustained 
productivity and growth.

Increase Performance Through Continuous Development
To drive performance improvement, organizations are increasingly turning 
to continuous development initiatives. This approach involves a proactive 
and ongoing effort to enhance employee skills and capabilities, ensuring 
they remain competitive and effective in their roles.
● One effective strategy is the implementation of ongoing micro-skills 
sprints. This approach encourages performers to acquire a new skill 
each month through targeted training and managerial coaching. By 
breaking down skill development into manageable monthly objectives, 
employees can steadily enhance their abilities and contribute more 
effectively to the organization's success.
● Real-time (AI) coaching is another innovative technique. It provides reps with 
immediate hints and guidance during their interactions with customers, 
enabling in-the-moment learning and skill reﬁnement. This real-time 
feedback loop can have a profound impact on performance and customer 
satisfaction.
● More recently we are seeing the use of AI to improve productivity by 
performing auxiliary tasks. Think of summarizing meetings, updating the 
CRM, and drafting follow-up emails. As AI continues to advance, we 
anticipate more productivity solutions that will streamline workﬂows and 
boost overall performance.
By embracing continuous development, organizations empower their employees 
to grow their skills incrementally, take advantage of real-time coaching, and 
leverage AI-driven productivity tools. These strategies collectively contribute to 
improved performance and competitive advantage in a rapidly evolving business 
landscape. 
Productivity in GTM roles is a challenge that requires a uniform perspective from 
hiring to streamlining onboarding, continuous development, and a performance 
culture using a coaching over a managing mindset. This will retain top 
performers and transform average contributors into top performers.

The Resurgence of the Academy
Companies like IBM, Cisco, and Xerox, once titans of innovation, owe a 
signiﬁcant part of their historical triumphs to their internal academies. These 
academies weren't mere training grounds; they were crucibles of knowledge and 
know-how, turning their workforce into a competitive differentiator. Few 
companies have since trotted that proven path. Due to incredible rate of 
innovation, combined with the lack of talent, leading companies will invest in an 
internal Academy which will train and coach on knowledge and know-how. 
These academies will be built around the importance of the human-to-human 
experience and augment, not replace it, with AI. 
Proven processes alone do not guarantee productivity; productivity is 
unlocked through the disciplined execution of these established processes. 
Discipline and process are inseparable partners, with processes providing 
the blueprint for necessary actions, while discipline ensures their effective 
execution. Together, they form the bedrock of productivity, enabling 
individuals and organizations to achieve their goals eﬃciently.
Discipline is a powerful force that empowers individuals to perform tasks 
accurately (on-task performance) and overcome challenges. It resembles 
having a plan and unwavering commitment to it, ensuring task completion, 
exceptional quality, and timeliness. Discipline serves as the catalyst, 
transforming potential into performance and setting the stage for success.
In recent years, discipline has received an undeservedly negative reputation; 
however, it is the key to turning the impossible into reality. The moon landing, 
for example, shows how discipline, characterized by rigorous planning, 
training, and on-task execution, played a pivotal role in accomplishing this 
extraordinary feat. Anyone who participated in the mission regards it as their 
proudest achievement. It proves that discipline not only unlocks rewards for 
organizations but also imparts a profound sense of accomplishment to 
individuals that can last a lifetime.

Lowering the Headcount Leads to an Increase in Productivity
In the quest for productivity, there's another valuable tool— managing the size of 
your workforce. In 2022, one of our clients reduced its sales organization from 
509 to 286 people. Within a year, this caused the productivity per rep to increase 
signiﬁcantly. In any reduction-in-force, the goal is to remove underperformers 
while not adversely affecting customers, quality, or revenue. Customers and 
other responsibilities are typically re-distributed to the remaining staff, whose 
acumen makes them well-suited to deliver results. Cutting costs is a growth 
initiative in these situations, not the opposite. 
In this real-life example, the client reduced its headcount over time. Initially, productivity 
per rep declined. However, as the discipline in executing the processes improved, 
productivity rose and eventually surpassed previous levels.
FIGURE 9.16
ACTION 4.
In summary: We identiﬁed 3 distinct cohorts of productivity: the Normal Group, 
the Swing Group, and the Bottom Group. The Normal Group representing 32% 
outperforms others by 1.53x in productivity. This disparity underscores the need 
for productivity improvement.  There are 4 steps to boost productivity: onboard 
faster, keep crew members longer, improve on-task performance, and lastly 
lower headcount by letting underperforming crew members go.

Breakpoint 10: Ensuring Interoperability
In our dedicated chapter, The Operating Model, we discuss the challenges 
organizations face with the growth of the number of GTM motions. Managing 
one GTM motion is feasible, but complexity escalates with each additional one. 
This is due to each GTM having its own language, data structure, and 
specialized tools. As an organization expands, the number of GTM motions can 
increase signiﬁcantly, compounding the diﬃculties. For example, a company 
with $100M in ARR might have around 10 GTM motions, while at $1B, this 
number could rise to as many as 20. Without standardization, employees 
become the translators further increasing complexity.

As ARR grows, the number of GTM motions increases. Most GTM motions do not 
interoperate with each other, in fact they are designed to compete with each other.
FIGURE 9.17
Interoperability, at its core, involves 3 essential elements: i) the use of a 
standardized data model, known as the Bowtie; ii) the adoption of a common 
language, illustrated by Impact; and iii) the creation of an open interface for 
method integration, as shown with SPICED. These elements not only boost 
eﬃciency but are crucial for unlocking AI's potential. Interoperable systems 
enhance AI-driven solutions through standardized data and system interactions, 
leading to accelerated learning and improved responses to customer needs. 
This grants companies a substantial competitive edge that is challenging for 
competitors to match.

Here are a few examples of how AI based on an interoperable GTM approach 
can accelerate growth:
● Optimize sales routes, lead scoring, and content personalization, ensuring 
that sales and marketing efforts are directed where they will be most 
effective, reducing wasted effort and increasing overall productivity.
● Provide managers insights into individual team members' performance, 
learning curves, and collaboration patterns. A data-driven approach enables 
managers to act like coaches, providing personalized support and guidance.
● Analyze vast amounts of customer data to provide insights into their needs 
and preferences, allowing contributors to provide a personalized experience.
The ability to analyze data at scale, automate routine tasks, personalize training, 
and support decision-making makes AI a powerful tool for mitigating 
productivity gaps. 
Breakpoint 11: Attaining Durability (Quality of Growth)
In the book's opening chapter, we drew parallels between a traditional factory 
and a recurring revenue business, especially for companies exceeding $10 
million in revenue. We aligned the objectives of the revenue factory as follows:
● Scalability: Increasing production in a factory is achieved by adding 
manufacturing lines. In a revenue factory, growing recurring revenue is 
accomplished by adding more GTM motions and providing them with 
additional resources.
● Sustainability: Enhancing cost eﬃciency in a factory corresponds to 
reducing costs to ensure Sustainability. Factories employ the elimination of 
waste as a key principle. Similarly, in the revenue factory model, this 
translates to achieving cost-eﬃcient growth and leveraging technology to 
streamline processes and reduce reliance on manual efforts.
Now, how do we relate Quality to the realm of a recurring revenue service?

Quality Equates to the Impact a Customer Gets out of Your Product
The quality of a software product is fundamentally determined by its impact. 
When a factory produces high-quality products, customers are inclined to want 
to buy more of them; think of Apple for example. In the software world, this 
principle remains unchanged and seamlessly aligns with the theme we have 
been talking about throughout this book: Impact. Durability, therefore, is a 
reﬂection of the ongoing Impact software products provide. 
What are key indicators of Impact? Valuable insights can be drawn from the PLG 
approach, where one of the key indicators of Impact is the usage of a product, 
measured through metrics like Daily Active Users (DAU) and Monthly Active 
Users (MAU). However, Impact goes beyond mere usage; it's about what 
customers do with the product and the outcomes they derive from it.  Let's use 
the example of an Applicant Tracking System (ATS) to identify different kinds of 
impact and how you can measure this::
● Increasing Users: can be measured by the increasing number of seats.
● Increase in Usage: can be gauged through login behavior, the number of job 
descriptions ﬁled, and the volume of responses received.
However, the ATS's impact goes above and beyond these metrics:
● The Rational Impact is evidenced in the quality of employees hired, but also 
the speed of the hiring process, and adherence to legal hiring processes. To 
improve this the software may offer AI guidance based on real-time best 
practices, resulting in candidates who are a better ﬁt for the organization.
Realizing that an ATS is a system that interacts with a lot of humans, which are 
emotional beings, therefore: 
● The Emotional Impact extends to the hundreds of applicants who may feel 
they were seen and share their positive experiences. Moreover, the product's 
user-friendly nature and its ability to seamlessly publish job listings across 
multiple platforms simpliﬁed the operator's life.
This goes far beyond just onboarding the customer and wishing them well.

Durability is about Aligning Recurring Revenue with Recurring Impact
In subscription-based businesses, organizations often focus on conventional 
practices such as onboarding, sharing use cases through email lists, addressing 
password recovery requests, and sending out year-end renewal invoices to 
secure recurring revenue. However, this approach reveals a misalignment 
between the impact customers achieve and the recurring revenue earned.
This underscores the essence of Durability: Aligning Recurring Revenue with the 
Recurring Impact that customers attain. Organizations often experience reduced 
retention when these 2 elements are not synchronized, as is frequently the case 
with annual-based SaaS contracts. Here are several strategies to align Recurring 
Revenue with Recurring Impact:
● Go beyond product onboarding; emphasize how customers can extract 
meaningful results from the product (see Moment 1 in Section 8.3.4).
● Transform the Quarterly Business Review (QBR), which typically focuses on 
what the seller wants from the renewal, into a Quarterly Impact Review 
centered on what both parties gain from the renewal.
● Shift the focus from identifying upsell opportunities based solely on usage to 
identifying customers with whom you can collaboratively achieve a more 
signiﬁcant impact (see Moment 3 in Section 8.3.4).
● Extend your assessment beyond the rational impact on the company and 
delve into the impact provided to users and operators (see Section 8.2.1).
● Evolve your approach, progressing from tracking seats sold to monitoring 
usage (logins), then from usage to measuring outputs created 
(reports/dashboards), and ultimately understanding how the product 
contributes to the achievement of a company's corporate goals (Impact).
By embracing these strategies, you will soon witness expansion-driven Growth 
surpassing Growth from customer acquisition. Expansion-driven Growth is more 
cost-effective, resulting in a surge in proﬁtability. What was once a startup with 
an appealing product has now evolved into a resilient business with a base of 
loyal customers.

This approach exhibits 3 key characteristics: i) it minimizes the inﬂuence of 
recency bias, ii) it creates a more comprehensive view of performance, and 
iii) it encourages widespread distribution. A case in point is Slack, which 
reports key metrics such as active users and conversation statistics monthly, 
thus establishing itself as an essential communication tool.

Case in Point: Boosting Renewals Through Timely Impact Reporting
In many organizations, monthly executive staff meetings are convened to 
unite functional heads in discussing progress toward the company's 
objectives. It's beneﬁcial to establish the schedule of these meetings during 
the customer onboarding process—for example, every ﬁrst Monday of the 
month. In the days preceding these meetings, your champion users will often 
rush to collect the necessary data for their reports. It presents a prime 
opportunity for your technology to excel by concisely summarizing the 
impact with clear progress charts. Submitting this data, along with a 
fantastic-looking chart and insights, in a timely manner signiﬁcantly 
increases the chances that your contributions will be included in the monthly 
status report, thereby signiﬁcantly enhancing the prospects for renewal and 
expansion.

Importance of Acquiring the Right Customers
To reach a state of Durability, companies must concentrate on acquiring the 
right customers—those who ﬁnd your impact indispensable. Such customers 
renew contracts and consider additional expansion. Net revenue retention (NRR) 
and gross revenue retention (GRR) emerge as pivotal metrics for a 
subscription-driven business. When evaluating the Durability of a recurring 
revenue business, consider that GRR holds more weight than NRR for several 
reasons:
GRR: Indicative of Durability
● Customer Stickiness: GRR is a simple metric that measures how well a 
company can retain revenue from existing customers. 
● Quality of Service: GRR serves as a more genuine indicator of your service's 
essential value to customers since it isn't inﬂuenced by expansion revenue.
● Predictability: A high GRR implies business stability, which is valuable during 
economic downturns when upselling and cross-selling are more challenging.
NRR: Growth-Oriented but Less about Durability
● Inclusion of Expansion Revenue: While a high NRR indicates business 
health, it might mask issues related to the core product or service offering.
● Economic Sensitivity: NRR is vulnerable to economic ﬂuctuations, 
making the business seem less durable during downturns.
● Not Core-Focused: NRR is more about demonstrating growth potential 
than core product stability and customer satisfaction.
As the company grows its revenue, it is common for subscription businesses to 
keep channeling premier resources disproportionately toward acquisition. This 
causes an inﬂux of new customers but at the same time neglect existing ones, 
thus negatively impacting GRR. This causes the company to grow its revenue 
but stay in the maturity phase of scalability or sustainability. 
To become durable the company has to balance its resources towards existing 
customers driving durable growth from expansion (and retention) which comes 
at a much lower cost thereby driving proﬁtability.

Fundamentally, from a GTM perspective, PLG shifts the focus from 
sales-led strategies to ones where the product itself is the main driver of 
customer acquisition, conversion, and expansion. In such a landscape, 
understanding user behavior, feature adoption, and customer engagement 
helps companies understand how customers interact with the product. 
Data guides the decision-making, helping reﬁne the product, optimize user 
experience, and prioritize feature development. It empowers businesses to 
respond quickly to market changes, customer needs, and emerging 
opportunities. In essence, a data-driven approach in PLG is what 
transforms insights into action. There are numerous metrics that offer 
valuable insights into customer engagement, product value, and areas for 
improvement. Here are some commonly tracked metrics:
● Monthly Active Users (MAU) and Daily Active Users (DAU): The number 
of unique users who engage with the product each month or day.
● DAU/MAU Ratio: A measure of engagement; a higher ratio indicates 
more frequent usage.
● User or Activity Scores:
○ Session Duration: How long users are actively using the product.
○ Feature Adoption Rate: Percentage of users who use a speciﬁc feature.
○ Time-to-Value (TTV): Time it takes for users to realize the value.
○ Engagement: Custom metrics measuring user interactions.
○ User Growth Rate: The rate at which the user base is expanding over a 
deﬁned time period.
Understanding how your customers use the product and what they are able 
to get out of it is the linchpin that connects product development to 
achieving customer impact.

Breakpoint 12: Maximizing Proﬁtability
When a privately venture-funded company goes public, it shifts from the realm 
of private ownership into the intense glare of public scrutiny. This transition 
necessitates a heightened sense of responsibility towards shareholders, stricter 
adherence to regulatory compliance, and unwavering pressure to not only 
maintain growth but also to prioritize the maximization of shareholder value, 
which ultimately boils down to proﬁtability.
Analyzing Public SaaS Companies' Performance
In April of 2023—more than a year after the SaaS market had experienced a 
crash—we examined the growth data of numerous public SaaS companies. We 
suspected that SaaS ﬁrms were allocating excessive ﬁnancial resources toward 
growth, hinting at a potential loss of GTM ﬁt. One of the pivotal metrics we 
scrutinized was the relationship between the cost of growth and the growth 
rate, as these metrics were available in the ﬁnancial reports of SaaS companies.
To gain insights into the challenges faced by the industry in 2023, we generated 
a chart on the following page (Figure 9.18). In this chart, the horizontal axis 
represents the annual growth rate, while the vertical axis portrays the cost of 
marketing and sales as a percentage of ARR. Note that both axes are depicted 
logarithmically. Within the chart, the bubble size corresponds to the business 
size reﬂected by the total ARR. 
For example, the 2 giant bubbles are Salesforce and Adobe, which are the 2 
largest SaaS companies, boasting revenues of $37 billion and $18 billion, 
respectively, as of January 2024.
Considering the growth rate (x-axis) as a measure of Scalability and the cost of 
growth (y-axis) as a measure of Sustainability, it becomes evident that many 
companies were pursuing growth at a high cost, consequently failing to attain 
Durability. They remained stuck in the Scalability stage, relentlessly striving for 
growth at any expense.

to the disproportionate cost of acquisition compared to the growth rate.
FIGURE 9.19
Areas of Opportunity for Increased Proﬁtability
Having been closely involved with over 2 dozen companies on this chart, we 
have learned that 3 common scenarios explain these high costs, pointing us to 
areas of opportunity for increased proﬁtability:
1. Diﬃculty in reducing expansion costs, often because expansion efforts 
have not been properly separated from acquisition teams.
2. Ineﬃciencies arise from a lack of interoperability and a uniform 
Operating Model.
3. Rapidly hiring many people but struggling to sustain productivity per 
GTM representative.
These issues keep the cost of acquiring and maintaining revenue high 
therefore these companies have not matured into the Durability stage.

For readers who are still on a journey to get to such a problem, realize that it is 
much easier to design your revenue factory to be scalable, sustainable, and 
durable from the beginning using the principles discussed in this book than it is 
to reverse the trend once habits, outdated systems, and processes have set in.
After going public, SaaS companies face pressure to maximize shareholder 
value but often struggle with ineﬃciencies. Our analysis shows most marketing 
and sales aren't delivering expected growth rates, hurting proﬁtability. The key 
issues are unclear expansion strategies, operational ineﬃciencies, and rapid, 
unproductive hiring. Addressing these early is essential for long-term success.
GTM costs typically include various expenses related to marketing and 
sales efforts aimed at acquiring growth from acquisition and expansion. 
These costs can include advertising, sales team salaries, marketing 
campaigns, and other expenses associated with acquiring and retaining 
customers. 
Under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) guidelines, 
certain expenses, such as those related to customer retention (like 
renewals), are categorized under Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) rather than 
being classiﬁed as marketing and sales expenses. This distinction is 
made because retention costs are directly tied to maintaining and 
delivering the product or service to existing customers, which is a 
component of the cost of goods sold.

GROWTH METRICS
In early 2022, numerous venture-funded SaaS companies showcased 
impressive ﬁnancial metrics, such as their Magic Number and the L TV to CAC 
ratio. However, business operators had been warning for months that the 
resources required to sustain the growth behind these metrics were 
unsustainable. Following the SaaS Crash, it became evident there was an 
apparent disconnect between the metrics presented at the board level and 
the realities faced by GTM teams. This disconnect can largely be attributed to 
the existence of different kind of metrics.
Hierarchy of Metrics
Not all metrics are created equal; there is a hierarchy with layers. Each layer has 
a different kind of metrics and a different emphasis:
● Investor Metrics: High-level indicators such as the L TV to CAC Ratio and 
Burn Multiple are crucial for investors as they often involve ratios of ﬁnancial 
and performance ﬁgures.
● Financial Metrics: Metrics like ARR, CAC, and FCF directly pertain to the 
company's ﬁnancial health.
● Performance Metrics: Operational teams rely on these to steer the business. 
Of particular note is the Growth Formula for each GTM motion.
● GTM Metrics: This layer encompasses detailed operational data—Volume 
Metrics (like lead counts), MRR, Time Metrics (like sales cycle lengths), Costs 
(including personnel and campaigns), and various Conversion Metrics.
All metrics originate from the same source: The Data Model, or Bowtie (see 
Figure 9.19). The interconnected nature of metrics is illustrated by dotted lines. 
When these metrics intersect, they form ratios. Additionally, these layers 
represent temporal aspects; GTM Metrics are closer to the data source, while 
Investor Metrics are more distant. This highlights the delay between Investor 
Insights and GTM metrics, emphasizing the real-time relevance of GTM data 
compared to the retrospective analysis often used by investors.

The key here is this: Executive or Investor Metrics are used to determine how 
best to allocate investments to hit metrics that improve valuation of a company. 
They are not intended to guide an operational team, such as sales leaders, to 
make decisions based on resource allocation in any given month. 
For making operational decisions, such as increasing SEO spend, hiring more 
salespeople, or determining the right time to add account managers, you need 
metrics closely aligned with the day-to-day operation. In the next section, we are 
going to explain the difference across 3 separate topics:
● Executive or Investor Metrics (9.3.1)
● Growth Maturity Phases (9.3.2)
● Performance or Operator Metrics (9.3.3))

Executive or Investor Metrics
When viewing investor growth metrics from an operational standpoint, they 
exhibit the following characteristics:
● Reﬂect the Business as a Whole: Metrics, like CAC and L TV, provide a 
high-level overview of the entire business. They offer a broad perspective, 
similar to taking a distant snapshot. However, to comprehend speciﬁc details 
and assess what's effective in various business segments, it's necessary to 
zoom in on individual aspects—for example, comparing the cost of customer 
acquisition to that of expansion within each GTM motion.
● Obscure Underlying GTM Metrics: Investor growth metrics can sometimes 
conceal what's transpiring within the business. For instance, a positive NRR 
may appear favorable but could be spoofed by a price increase.
● Are Based on Ratios: Optimizing one ratio may come at the expense of 
another. For instance, metrics like the L TV to CAC ratio may encourage a 
focus on short-term ﬁnancial outcomes at the potential cost of long-term 
Sustainability, such as prioritizing proﬁtability over customer success.
● Trailing Indicators: These metrics reﬂect past performance and serve as 
trailing indicators. They may not offer real-time insights into the current 
state of the business. This lag can result in growth metrics appearing strong 
while the market has already shifted, as in 2021 and 2022.
● Dependent on the Context: The interpretation of these metrics hinges on the 
context of a business. What proves effective for one company or industry 
may not be universally applicable. It's crucial to consider the unique 
circumstances of your business when relying on investor metrics.
These characteristics highlight the importance of not relying on investors' 
metrics to make investment decisions when operating a recurring revenue 
business. Metrics like CAC:L TV ratio, Burn Multiple, FCF margin, and the Rule of 
40 are not intended for guiding day-to-day operational decisions.

In practice, founders, CEOs, and revenue leaders gain insights from venture 
partners regarding which metrics, in the form of Key Performance Indicators 
(KPIs), are crucial for attaining the highest valuation. Subsequently, their ﬁnance 
and revenue leadership teams align the business toward achieving these KPIs. 
These KPIs not only facilitate the acquisition of additional funding but also 
require improving these investor-driven metrics, further driving up valuation. This 
pressure can lead operators to spoof the necessary growth metrics, a topic we 
discuss next.
Spooﬁng of Investor Growth Metrics
Spooﬁng, or falsifying information to deceive or manipulate, has been used in 
various areas, from technology and cybersecurity to entertainment. It's not a 
shock that people who stand to gain so much from a company's valuation 
choose to manipulate growth metrics. It often happens with sincere intentions. 
For example, during the Golden Era, venture-backed companies were valued 
based on the growth rate, leaving us today with the ramiﬁcations of the 
growth-at-all-costs generation felt in every part of the business. Here are some 
examples of growth metrics being spoofed today:
● Growth Rate Spooﬁng: Privately owned companies can decide how and 
when to recognize revenue. For example, do multi-year contracts book all 
on the day they close or when they are consumed? These decisions can 
have radical implications for growth metrics.
● Retention Spooﬁng: Retention can be measured against logos, seats, 
revenues, and usage. One may present an incorrect picture of what is 
happening by excluding a speciﬁc user group that exhibits high churn 
metrics, such as single-seat sign-ups. At the same time the growth of 
single-seats are used elsewhere to reﬂect a high growth rate.
● ARR Spooﬁng: A common area of ARR spooﬁng is to include hybrid 
revenue, such as services. Some of this may even be "re-occurring" 
revenue. As we explained elsewhere, re-occurring revenue differs from 
recurring revenue from a subscription contract and reﬂects a lower 
valuation.

## Page 366

C H A P T E R   0 9   |   G R O W T H   M O D E L
● NRR Spooﬁng: One of the few SaaS-centric metrics reported by many 
SaaS companies. It remains unregulated, and therefore, it is expected to 
be a metric that will be spoofed in the coming years. And there's a reason 
for it: NRR can easily be spoofed. For example, if retention goes down by 
5–7% due to the loss of customers, the seller can raise the product's price 
by the same amount, thereby spooﬁng NRR.
While these tactics may serve short-term interests, they can lead to a distorted 
understanding of a company's performance and value. This will undermine 
investor conﬁdence and, more importantly, misguide operational strategies. 
Adhering to transparent and honest practices in reporting growth metrics is 
essential for businesses aiming for long-term success and Sustainability.
At this point, it must be clear that relying on Investor Metrics for day-to-day 
operations is not the most effective approach. This is the reason for GTM 
metrics, and as we previously discussed (in Sections 9.1 and 9.2.11), these 
metrics vary depending on the maturity phase. So, let's begin by deﬁning the 
metrics for each maturity phase based on what we've learned so far.
Growth Maturity Phases
All complex things can be reduced to simple fundamentals. Similarly, for 
hypergrowth companies, the objective of the entire operation can be 
deduced to these 3 simple goals:
● Provide a great product(s) that customers are thrilled about.
● Grow the revenue.
● Improve your proﬁts by lowering the cost due to economies of scale.
Here, it's essential to distinguish between venture-backed and non-venture- 
backed companies. In the latter's case, proﬁtability usually comes before 
reinvestment in growth—a process can take years due to the time needed for 
hiring and operational scaling. However, venture-backed companies focus on 
investing in the potential for growth ahead of proﬁts.

High Performing Revenue Factory
As we learned in the previous section, this is where the danger lies. The 
scramble for funding can set companies on a precarious course, leading to a 
Pyrrhic victory where the company burns through valuable resources without 
ever being able to achieve a proﬁt. To mitigate this risk, we outline 3 phases 
of growth that align with the company's maturity level:
● Maturity Phase 1: Focus on growth to achieve Scalability.
● Maturity Phase 2: Focus on cost-eﬃcient growth to achieve Sustainability.
● Maturity Phase 3: Focus on the quality of growth to strive for Durability. 
This provides a clear direction for operational growth metrics: identify the right 
metrics in each phase (see Figure 9.19) and work towards achieving set goals. 
The ﬁrst phase's message is simple: "Go win as many deals as possible." During 
a board meeting, an investor might ask, "If we provide twice the funding, can you 
grow twice as fast?" As you transition to the next phase, the focus shifts to 
Capital Eﬃcient Growth. Investors may  ask, "Is there a way to leverage more 
technology (AI) to reduce costs?"

Lastly, like a factory striving to increase production while reducing costs, a 
hyper-growth organization must prioritize durable growth. It entails a focus on 
Quality, where Quality equates to Recurring Impact when it comes to recurring 
revenue. Investors might ask, “Can you develop additional products for your 
customer base?” All of this starts at the beginning: Achieving Scalability.
Maturity Phase 1: Achieving Scalability
This phase starts around $1M to $2M in ARR or 2,000 users. Sellers start to 
recognize patterns in the buying behavior—who is buying, how they are buying, 
what features they value the most, and the words they use to reﬂect the impact 
of the product (#1). These insights help in picking the ﬁrst GTM motion (#4).  
The goal for scaling is to map the GTM motion into a well-oiled process (#5), 
represented by a Growth Formula (#6), based on data and trendlines (#3).  
1. Pricing & Packaging Pricing (annual/monthly), tiers, payment terms, refund 
terms, and discount policies have been established.
2. Leverage Founder-Led Growth Founder plays an important but no longer operationally 
critical role.
3. Standardize Data Model A standardized Data Model is used across all departments, 
regions, verticals, and segments.
4. Structured in GTM Model(s) A structured growth strategy using different (but not too 
many) GTM motions mapped to the data structure.
5. Repeatable Process/GTM Model Establish a process per GTM motion, write it down so it 
can be explained and people can be trained on it.
6. Growth Formula/GTM Model Establish a Growth Formula per GTM motion that matches 
the process. 
Scalability primarily focuses on acquisition, so crucial metrics revolve around 
pipeline conversion and sales metrics, such as price and the sales cycle. It 
doesn't mean you can ignore customer success; however, your goal is to cast 
a wide net to gauge how scalable your product is, which may result in low 
retention rates. And that is okay in the Scalability phase.
The ﬁrst 6 revenue breakpoints are mapped to ScalabilityTABLE 9.8

## Page 369

C H A P T E R   0 9   |   G R O W T H   M O D E L
Track the acquisition metrics; you will need the data later when launching the 
next GTM. Monitor expansion metrics, indicating which customers derive 
signiﬁcant impact from your product. Achieving Scalability takes about $8M in 
ARR for a GTM motion, but be warned—the costs can be steep. Therefore, this 
phase depends on early-stage funding by investors who help achieve GTM ﬁt.
Deliverable: Each GTM motion must have a Growth Formula (#6).
Maturity Phase 2: Becoming Sustainable
At this stage, organizations begin scrutinizing costs and striving to make their 
chosen GTM motion sustainable through economies of scale and technological 
advancements. Achieving Sustainability is generally a multi-year process and 
may involve launching alternative GTM motions to increase velocity (#7). Seen 
through the lens of a GTM motion, we're focusing on both the growth (#6) and 
the cost of that growth (#8) in acquisition, retention, and expansion.
369
7. Velocity Based Growth Use the company's most valuable resources to drive the 
GTM motion with the highest growth rate.
8. Sustainable Growth Ability to track what each GTM motion is costing and a 
trendline shows the costs are declining.
9. Increase Productivity Productivity per GTM rep is measured; programs to 
shorten ramp time and improve productivity are in place.
10. Ensure Interoperability A standardized Data Model, uniform methodology and a 
common language is used across all GTM motions.
When a subscription business reaches around $30M in revenue, most of its 
recurring revenue stream will come from retention. Here, executives must 
exercise caution. History has proven that most executive teams instinctively 
continue to invest disproportionately in acquisition. Don't fall for this; growth 
from retention has become equally important and requires the same level of 
investment. And once you surpass $50M in ARR, there needs to be a balanced 
investment across all growth areas: acquisition, retention, and expansion.
Revenue breakpoints 7 to 10 are mapped to Sustainability.TABLE 9.9

11. Attain Durability The company focuses on anchoring itself on Customer 
Impact.
12. Achieve Proﬁtability The key GTM motions are proﬁtable, with enough FCF to 
fund innovations where needed.
As discussed in an earlier section (Section 9.2.12), when you pass $50M in ARR, 
your growth rate should still be over 40%, GTM metrics should trend towards 
increased proﬁtability based on improved conversion rates (#9), and steady 
decline in cost metrics improving productivity (#9). At this stage, organizations 
must structure the myriad of GTM motions (#10), including letting go of some 
costly GTM motions that have been trending in the wrong direction. This phase 
often aligns with late-stage funding to help the company reach Scaleup ﬁt and 
prepare for an IPO.
Deliverable: Each GTM motion must have a Growth Formula and a cost picture.
Maturity Phase 3: Pushing for Durability
In the third phase, external funding to drive the business starts to take a 
backseat, and the spotlight shifts to the company's ability to self-sustain and 
grow organically. The critical transition here is that your growth engine is 
powered by existing customers through renewals, expansions, and even 
customer-generated leads that help reduce acquisition costs. The dependency 
has shifted—from relying on external funding to relying on existing customer 
base. As we have learned, this is based on happy customers who achieve the 
desired impact from the product they commit to.
Here are several aspects to consider:
● Customer-Centric Focus: Customer satisfaction and retention are 
paramount. Happy customers who achieve the desired impact from your 
product are your best advocates. A focus on delivering exceptional value 
and ensuring customer success is essential.
Two revenue breakpoints are mapped to Durability.TABLE 9.10
370

## Page 371

C H A P T E R   0 9   |   G R O W T H   M O D E L
● Renewal and Expansion Strategies: Your revenue growth is driven by 
existing customers renewing their subscriptions and expanding their usage. 
Implementing effective renewal and expansion strategies becomes critical. 
It includes whitespace planning around upsell opportunities, cross-selling 
complementary products, and continuously demonstrating the value of your 
solutions.
● Organic Lead Generation: Customer referrals and organic lead generation 
play a signiﬁcant role. Satisﬁed customers are more likely to recommend 
your product to others. There should be a clear shift to customer marketing 
with advocacy programs that fuel organic growth.
● Investment in Product Quality: The focus on delivering recurring impact 
makes product quality the cornerstone of Durability; a fantastic product can 
overcome almost any GTM challenge. Continuously improve your product 
to meet evolving customer needs and maintain high satisfaction; for 
example, invest in addressing user feedback within the product. 
● Exploring Growth Initiatives: While the focus is on self-sustainability, there 
may be opportunities for strategic growth initiatives. Consider entering new 
markets, expanding your product portfolio, or enhancing customer success 
efforts to solidify your market position further.
For those companies not completely ready, an E-round of funding can be 
inserted to overcome issues such as accelerating product development (PLG), 
entering an international market to drive growth (SLG), or expanding the 
customer success efforts to push for Durability demonstrated by improved 
GRR/NRR metrics.
Deliverable: Customers causing eﬃcient revenue growth.

In 2020, we consulted for a company that offered a software developer 
platform. Their sales team was compensated for both customer 
acquisition and expansion sales. The standard purchase price for a newly 
acquired customer was $22,000, while expansion deals typically reached 
$45,000.
This approach gave rise to 2 issues. First, it led the sellers to prioritize 
expansion, resulting in a slowdown in customer acquisition. Second, 
because the compensation structure for expansion deals mirrored that of 
acquisition, it made the cost of expansion equal to the cost of acquisition. 
For reference, the cost of expansion should ideally be between 1/4th and 
1/6th of the cost of acquisition. By continuing to use salespeople for 
expansion, the cost of growth remained exceptionally high in the 
subsequent years.
To prepare the company for the public markets, our recommendation was 
simple: separate expansion from acquisition and staff the expansion team 
with specialized personnel and a compensation package aligned with the 
business. Such a restructuring should have been put in place when growth 
from expansion starts to exceed growth from acquisition.
This transformation is categorized as a phase shift and it typically takes 
about 2 years to complete. Unfortunately, many companies tend to initiate 
this transition too late, waiting until they approach $100 million in ARR, and 
relying on a later investment rounds to fund the  transformation.
In this case, our client chose not to make this transition before the IPO. 
Unfortunately, the new public investors were less forgiving than the private 
investors had been. Following the initial enthusiasm, the stock experienced 
a sharp decline.
Unsurprisingly, it took our client about 2 years to regain its footing, a 
moment that was memorialized with the headline: "Shares Surge As ACME 
Posts Its First Proﬁt Ever."
CASE IN POINT: GOING IPO

Performance or Operator Metrics
To be successful, you don't need to operate the business along every 
possible growth metric from day one. Instead, successful companies 
focus on a few metrics in each maturity phase:
● Phase I. Scalability Metrics focus on ARR and Growth Rate
● Phase II. Sustainability Metrics focus on CAC Payback, CAC, and CTS
● Phase III. Durability Metrics focus on GRR and NRR 
The intention behind this approach is to enhance focus on a few speciﬁc 
metrics and, by doing so, increase the chances of achieving success.
Scalability Metrics (ARR and Growth Rate)
GTM motions in PMF must monitor 3 speciﬁc metrics: number of customers, 
pricing & packaging, and revenue per customer. These metrics form the 
foundation for the ﬁrst operational plan, deﬁning how many customers are 
needed to generate the next revenue milestone. GTM motions trying to achieve 
GTMF shift their focus on conversion metrics, exploring how many leads are 
needed to create the right opportunities and deals. Capacity problems may arise 
due to the lack of operational processes; for example, hiring processes may 
cause the ramp of new employees to take too long.

In this phase, it feels like it's run on power drinks; each month, new records are 
set, more deals are signed, and deal sizes grow larger and larger. Revenue 
continues to grow, but retention can become a challenge. The company is forced 
to establish processes and begins to function as a factory.

Sustainability Metrics
At ﬁrst, it was all about growth, but as the scale gets bigger, cost comes into 
play. What is critical, and a point that we will keep coming back to, is that 
success in this phase requires companies to calculate the cost for each GTM 
motion that covers not just acquisition but the entire customer journey. 
In this stage, companies launch new GTM motions based on data-driven 
decisions, which GTM motions they are betting on are based on growth/growth 
rate (Growth Formula) and cost/payback (CAC Payback).
Companies get stuck in the Scalability phase primarily because they stay too 
long focused on growth from acquisition. However, those stuck in Sustainability 
mode tend to do so because they have too many GTM motions. It causes the 
(too thinly) spreading of resources. And, if companies cannot single out the cost 
per GTM motion, the company does not know where to invest its resources, and 
that means there are going to be a lot of ineﬃcient campaigns, a low conversion 
on those who signed up for the trial, and a lot of salespeople operating well 
below quota. One of the key challenges at this stage is the rapidly growing size 
of the company and the associated payroll. And to no surprise, many companies 
experience a drop in productivity as the number of employees increases.

Durability Metrics
Reaching this stage is a remarkable achievement, as only 1 out of 20 startups 
typically makes it here, often requiring substantial funding. At this point, venture 
funds aim to maximize their investments. Therefore, it should come as no 
surprise that critical metrics for Durability include GRR and Gross Margin.
GRR is pivotal as it measures revenue retention from existing customers, directly 
indicating product indispensability and long-term business durability. Gross 
margin becomes a priority well before a company goes public, often as early as 
reaching $50M in ARR. Precise knowledge of GTM motion costs is now crucial. 
With less funding available, companies must closely monitor their free cash ﬂow 
(FCF), which indicates available resources for growth initiatives like new 
features, customer events, or market expansion.
By adhering to this structured approach, companies can aspire to reach $1B in 
ARR while meeting their growth and proﬁtability targets. This data-driven 
approach ensures durable growth to meet market demands and seize new 
opportunities. It also helps secure the necessary funding, but this time around, 
from happy customers purchasing more products.

RECAP GROWTH MODEL
The Growth Model is shaped like an S-curve and covers 4 key stages: 
Startup, Scaleup, Grownup, and Enterprise. A company's position on this curve is 
determined by its annual recurring revenue, the number of years since it passed 
$1M in ARR, and the trend of its growth rate. This framework not only provides a 
snapshot of a company's current stage but also offers a roadmap for what 
comes next. We have identiﬁed 12 revenue breakpoints along the S-curve, to 
help companies navigate growth complexities, foresee potential pitfalls, and 
adequately prepare for inevitable phase shifts. 
1. Pricing and Packaging: Establish pricing tiers and payment terms.
2. Founder-Led Growth: Transition the founder's role from operational to strategic.
3. Standardize Data Model & Structure: Implement a standardized data model 
across all departments and segments.
4. GTM Motions: Align all roles and functions involved in the customer journey.
5. Repeatable Processes: Document and train GTM teams on proven processes 
for each GTM motion.
6. Growth Formula: Establish a Growth Formula for each GTM motion.
7. Velocity-Based Growth: Allocate resources to GTM motions with the highest 
growth rates.
8. Sustainable Growth: Monitor and reduce costs for each GTM motion through 
iterative improvements and waste elimination.
9. Increase Productivity: Measure and enhance GTM rep productivity, streamline 
onboarding, improve skills, and address underperformance.
10. Interoperability: Ensure interoperability across all GTM motions fostering a 
common language, a standardized data model, and a uniform methodology.
11. Durability: Focus on impact driving up customer retention and expansion, using 
specialized teams and dedicated processes that operate at a lower of the cost.
12. Proﬁtability: Ensure proﬁtability in all GTM motions and allocate funds for 
innovation to keep the product delivering impact.
By mapping these 12 Revenue Breakpoints to the S-Curve, and along the 
maturity phases we get the Growth Model depicted in the following ﬁgure.

The company progresses through 3 phases aligned with its maturity level, 
utilizing operational growth metrics to tailor their focus.
● Phase I, Scalability, emphasizes recognizing buying patterns and 
establishing eﬃcient growth processes, focusing on ARR and Growth Rate.
● Phase II, Sustainability, prioritizes cost-eﬃcient growth and balance 
between acquisition, retention, and expansion, spotlighting CAC Payback 
and cost metrics for acquisition, retention, and expansion..
● Phase III, Durability, marks a shift to self-sustainability, driven by existing 
customer relationships, emphasizing customer renewal and expansion 
strategies, product quality, and GRR and Gross Margin metrics.
Adhering to this structured approach will help companies to scale to $1B in ARR, 
achieve growth and proﬁtability targets, and ensure durable growth by securing 
growing revenue from happy customers who come back for more.

One of the most common challenges companies face is selecting the suitable 
GTM motion for their product or executing the chosen GTM motion poorly. This 
challenge arises from organizations implementing a departmental model rather 
than structuring their GTM motions effectively. The GTM model provides insights 
into the selection and structuring of GTM motions, recommending the 
appropriate one that aligns marketing, sales, and customer success efforts to 
ensure customers achieve recurring impact, thereby securing recurring revenue. 
This alignment is guided by 2 key metrics: the number of deals per year for 
scalability and the average recurring contract value per year for sustainability.
380
The GTM model contains today's 5 most common GTM motions. Each of the blocks can 
be human-led, channel-led, product-led, etc.

The GTM model is explained as follows:
● How the GTM Model Works (10.1)
● Putting the GTM Model to Work (10.2)
● Determining the Scalability of a GTM Motion (10.3)
● Determining the Sustainability of a GTM Motion (10.4)
● Determining the Durability of a GTM Motion (10.5)
Each GTM motion should be based on a proven, repeatable process, and each 
one should be scalable to achieve high-velocity growth and, over time, become 
sustainable (cost-eﬃciency). Lastly, GTM motions can achieve durability by 
focusing on delivering customer impact (quality), which drives more customers 
to renew and expand, thereby generating recurring revenue at a lower cost.
HOW THE GTM MODEL WORKS
The GTM model plays a crucial role in bringing alignment across all customer- 
facing roles, and holds a prominent position among the other models for good 
reason. Unlike the Revenue Model, which tends to remain relatively static, the 
GTM Model is a dynamic hub of activity. In our daily routines, we engage with 
the GTM model through dashboards that provide operational insights. We use it 
to make decisions such as adjusting marketing campaigns, updating pricing, 
monitoring the number of daily active users, and expanding our sales team, 
among other things. It constantly evolves and is responsive to trends, especially 
those driven by innovative technologies, such as the advances in AI.
What can we learn from the GTM Model?
The GTM model is instrumental in selecting the GTM motion that aligns the 
revenue generated from an account with the associated costs to manage an 
account. This alignment is crucial in a subscription business, where costs can 
be substantial and it takes considerable time to achieve CAC Payback.

The X-Y Framework of the GTM Model
When you commit to a single-user application license for $50 per year, it's not 
typically anticipated that the seller will arrange an on-site stakeholder meeting 
involving the CFO and CEO. The seller must onboard 100,000 users at this 
price to reach an annual revenue of 5 million dollars. On the contrary, when a 
company opts for a platform with a $500,000 per year subscription, only 10 
deals are required and it's not expected that the buyer will purchase by 
entering credit card details on a self-serve website. This distinction forms the 
basis of the X-Y framework within the GTM model.
In this X-Y framework, the horizontal axis represents the annualized value of 
the subscription: the annual contract value (ACV). The ACV only includes the 
recurring revenue part of the model, not one-time services such as installation 
or re-occurring services such as training, nor any upfront costs such as 
on-premise equipment. To be sustainable, the ACV directly affects how much 
we can spend annually on managing the customer. The vertical axis represents 
the volume of deals per year, winning 10 deals vs. 100,000 deals, which is 
indicative of the needed scalability level. It is worth noting that this Y-axis is 
logarithmic, while the X-axis is divided into categories.

Market Segments
Market segments refer to identiﬁable groups of businesses or organizations that 
share common characteristics and needs. These characteristics can relate to 
industry type, company size, geographic location, buying behavior, and speciﬁc 
challenges or requirements. Segmentation empowers businesses to tailor their 
products, services, marketing strategies, and sales approaches to better address 
the unique needs of different segments within the broader business market. 
This approach enables companies to focus their efforts more effectively and 
eﬃciently rather than employing a one-size-ﬁts-all approach.
Building upon the X-Y framework, we can overlay some of the most prevalent 
market segments, including Consumers, Pro-users, Small Teams, Very Small 
Businesses (VSB), Small to Medium-sized Businesses (SMB), Mid-Market, 
Enterprises, and Fortune 500. It indicates you can adapt and scale your GTM 
motions to adjacent segments evolving to higher or lower price ranges.
Next, we will map commonly used sales, marketing, and customer motions to 
this framework. With it, this framework becomes a guide to align the most 
suitable GTM motion with the market segment you want to pursue.

Sales Motions
In the ever-evolving landscape of sales, understanding your GTM motions is 
crucial. Whether you're a Startup seeking your ﬁrst customers or a Scaleup 
aiming to compete in new markets, choosing the correct sales motion can be a 
game-changer. Below, we've outlined some of the most popular sales motions:
● Self-Service: Here, customers can purchase and onboard themselves 
without speaking to a salesperson. Think Shopify or Dropbox—these 
platforms are easy to understand; try and buy.
● Inside Sales (1-Stage): This is generally an inbound approach, where 
customers navigate the journey mostly independently but may reach out 
with questions about things such as compatibility. It works well when 
selling pro-user licenses to experts in their ﬁeld, like Adobe Effects users.
● Inside Sales (2-Stage): This approach divides the work between those 
who qualify leads and set up meetings (sales development reps) and 
higher-skilled sellers who close the deals. This model thrives in an 
outbound motion, particularly in vertical market segments where the 
company has a strong brand name. Think of Procore selling into the 
construction industry.
● Field Sales (Team): A direct sales force often living close to the customer. 
Unlike inside sales, ﬁeld sales reps augment their online meetings with 
in-person visits. Historically, this has been the standard method for 
medium- to high-value deals that require a broader understanding and, as 
a result, involve more complexities, leading to longer sales cycles.
● Named-Account Sales (Team): Suited for complex, high-value deals, this 
approach is tailored to large organizations and involves multiple 
stakeholders. Salespeople act as consultants, navigating complex 
decision-making processes and understanding the pain points of different 
stakeholders to recommend tailored solutions.
In the following ﬁgure (see Figure 10.5), we align these GTM sales motions with 
the GTM model based on the ACV and the volume of annual commitments.  It is 
important to note that the number of commitments reﬂects the total number of 
customers acquired, retained, and expanded.

Salaries and expenses are crucial elements in recurring revenue models, as 
illustrated in Table 10.1. It provides insight into how much each sales motion 
could cost and provides an idea of what revenue targets those teams would be 
expected to achieve, facilitating budget planning and strategy development in 
sales operations. As you can tell, human involvement typically multiplies costs,     
and by taking this into account, the alignment of various sales motions with the 
ACV of a product becomes evident.

Marketing Motions
Marketing has come a long way—from billboards and broad advertising to 
micro-targeting individuals based on person speciﬁc intent data. Amidst this 
complexity, engaging your target audience in a meaningful conversation remains 
one of the trickiest aspects of the entire customer journey.
Whether you're on a quest to land your ﬁrst client or scaling into new territories, 
the challenge is real. That's why we've distilled the marketing maze into 5 
timeless B2B marketing motions. Each has unique strengths and ﬁts various 
business needs, and they've all found innovative ways to leverage the latest 
technology for maximum impact.
● Inbound Marketing: Through SEO, content creation, referrals, and paid 
advertising (SEM and display ads), inbound marketing attracts customers by 
offering valuable, relevant content and offers. This approach aims to convert 
prospects into customers. Example tactics include blogs, white papers, 
podcasts, and eBooks tailored to address speciﬁc industry challenges; paid 
search terms to capture prospects while searching for solutions; and display 
ads designed to intersect with prospects where they spend time online. PLG 
teams often build "loops" into their products–opportunities for existing 
customers to attract new users via invitations, alerts, reports, publishing 
tools, and collaboration requests.
● Outbound Marketing: This approach uses timed email campaigns to engage 
speciﬁc customer groups. Outbound marketing is helpful for lead nurturing, 
pipeline building, and customer retention. Newsletters are a typical tactic 
used by companies in the B2B space.
● Targeted Marketing: Often called account-based marketing, or ABM, this 
method focuses on individual accounts by employing customized 
campaigns. The marketing medium and message are tailored based on 
each account's unique attributes and needs. ABM tactics range from 
customized, attention-getting mailers to individualized invitations to broad 
stakeholder engagement across known personas at the target account.

## Page 388

C H A P T E R   1 0    |   G T M   M O D E L
● Networking: Networking is a classic but often underrated B2B strategy. 
Networking is most effective in small, informal settings like lunch meetings 
or golf outings. Industry events, such as regional trade shows and "city 
workshops," offer broader but less targeted opportunities. Professional 
member societies that require speciﬁc credentials are among the most 
popular as a networking platform.
● Word of Mouth: This strategy relies on satisﬁed customers and industry 
inﬂuencers voluntarily advocating for your product on social media or in 
local communities. Brandname, image, high customer satisfaction, 
compelling user experiences, and targeted inﬂuencer partnerships drive 
this motion. 
While organic, its impact can be ampliﬁed through referral programs such 
as organizing in-region events. Aﬃliate and inﬂuencer marketing are 
non-organic forms of word of mouth. At the same time, social media 
platforms like TikTok, LinkedIn, and X (previously known as Twitter) help 
generate a word-of-mouth buzz. 
By aligning these marketing motions with the sales motions we discussed 
earlier, we add an another layer to the GTM model (see Figure 10.6).

There are a several well-known combinations where speciﬁc marketing motions 
align seamlessly with corresponding sales motions. These synergistic pairings 
create the most effective and eﬃcient customer acquisition processes. Let's 
delve into some of these noteworthy combinations:
● Inbound Marketing Maps to Self-Serve and 1-Stage Inside Sales: Due  
to the high volume of leads needed, Inbound marketing (content) aligns 
seamlessly with self-serve and 1-stage inside sales motions, especially 
targeting VSBs and small teams.
● Outbound Marketing Supports Growth Investment in Targeted Markets: 
Companies must actively reach potential customers to achieve the 
necessary volume. If companies are willing to invest more in growth, they 
can prospect for new customers. A 2-stage outbound approach may make 
sense when targeting Small and Medium-sized Businesses (SMBs) or 
vertical SaaS markets. While inbound marketing relies on content and SEO, 
outbound motion leverages thought leadership events and city-based 
workshops to attract the right buyers.
● Targeted Marketing Complements Field Sales: Field sales beneﬁt from 
targeted marketing, which pairs well with Account-Based Marketing (ABM) 
campaigns. Targeting accounts requires a deep understanding of who the 
ideal customers are (ICP). For a more detailed explanation of the difference 
between Targeting and Outbounding, refer to section 8.3.1, "Means and 
Methods in Lead Generation."
● Networking and Direct Executive Engagement Support Named-Account 
Sales: When employing a named account sales strategy, the focus is on 
identifying the right executives at named accounts. Establishing a 
relationship without an introduction can take 9 to 18 months.
Up to this point, we've focused mainly on customer acquisition. However, 
it's crucial to understand that signiﬁcant growth often comes from customer 
success—more speciﬁcally, retention and expansion. We will delve into this 
commonly misunderstood topic next.

Customer Success Motions
While acquisition sets the stage, the fundamental cornerstones of long-term 
growth are retention and expansion—elements mainly managed by customer 
success (CS). CS reﬂects a multitude of activities such as Onboarding, Adoption 
and Engagement, Customer Retention, Expansion and Upselling Opportunities, 
Customer Advocacy Programs, Feedback and Insights Gathering, Health Scoring 
and Risk Mitigation, Customer Education, Account Management, and creation of 
Personalized Customer Experiences.
In a competitive landscape where customer loyalty is increasingly elusive, CS 
motions determine the success or failure of a recurring revenue business. To 
help navigate this, we're honing in on the 2 indispensable motions in any CS 
playbook: community and helpdesk.
● Community: "Community" is a catch-all representing the range of options 
for self-service customers. The center of a community strategy is the 
knowledge base: a database with self-help resources, often front-ended by 
a chatbot. The community strategy may also include an opportunity for 
power-user customers, experts, and your team to converge to solve 
problems and share experiences. As users assist each other, the support 
load on your team decreases. 
● Helpdesk: Think of the helpdesk as your company's emergency room— 
organized, fast, and effective at triaging and troubleshooting. The helpdesk 
is staffed by on-call personnel to answer questions and track down issues. 
It is your oﬃcial channel for customer support, using ticketing systems or 
live chats.
These ﬁrst 2 motions play a role across the entire spectrum of customer 
success activities. The customer journey through customer success includes 
Onboarding, Retention, and Expansion stages. It may mean you have specialized 
onboarders, CSMs, and account managers, each tasked to achieve speciﬁc 
outcomes using one of the following approaches:
10.1.5
390

## Page 391

C H A P T E R   1 0    |   G T M   M O D E L
● Volume-Based: In a volume based approach one CSM manages a number 
of accounts to adoption—say, up to 500. Volume-based requires the CS to 
have knowledge on the applications of the products and the impact they 
provide. In this approach eﬃciency is absolute key. The community remains 
the front line for most issues, while the helpdesk acts as a secondary line of 
support.
● Vertical-Based: As the ACV increases CSM are required to have a deeper 
industry and application knowledge. Therefore, it is unsurprising that in this 
approach the CSM is dedicated to a speciﬁc industry, such as healthcare. 
This less common, highly specialized approach integrates the community 
and the helpdesk to address unique industry needs, often using its own 
language. Think of education, ﬁnancial services, and manufacturing. 
● Account-Based: A CSM focusing on high-value (F500) accounts like 
Disney or Amazon is referred to as an account-based approach. These 
CSMs have an intimate understanding of the account, its organizational 
structure, and the company's business objective. The community is an 
advocacy platform, and the helpdesk recognizes the number and 
escalates to the dedicated CSM to offer a highly personalized service..
Ideally, you’d use a mix of these customer success motions to create a 
well-rounded, effective customer success approach.

GTM Motions
There is a range of terms to describe different GTM motions. For example, when 
you ask a GTM professional what kind of GTM motion they use, they may 
answer: "We use a low touch GTM motion to sell into the SMB market, using a 
combination of inbound marketing and an SDR/AE sales team." 
Let's untangle these terms by exploring their origins and usage:
● Market Segmentation: The primary segments are VSBs, SMBs, mid-market, 
and enterprises. In this case, the GTM professional mentioned "SMB." 
However, segments are not a determining factor; for example, an SMB may 
buy a $100,000 SaaS service that requires an enterprise GTM motion. 
● Marketing & Sales Strategy: "Inbound marketing" and "an SDR/AE sales 
team" describe how businesses engage with the market segments. But it 
often overlooks the role Customer Success plays.
● GTM Approach: The reference to "a low touch GTM motion " corresponds to 
the engagement level. In this case, "low touch" hints at a low cost.
There often is overlap among these, which can be confusing. For example, an 
outbound strategy could target both SMBs and smaller groups within an 
Enterprise. It is for this reason that we will focus on describing the chosen GTM 
approach using the "touch" concept, which involves all customer-facing roles.
The Touch Concept: A Unifying Framework
The term "touch" has been used in the industry since 2010 to quantify the level  of 
customer engagement. David Skok, an early pioneer in this ﬁeld, developed a 
framework outlining the costs of various sales complexities. Skok noted, "Touch 
levels provide a measurable standard for human effort in the sales process, 
allowing for resource allocation and strategy alignment." In his work, Skok outlines 
different touch levels that we are going to map into the GTM framework:
● No Touch: Syncs inbound marketing, a self-serve (credit card) purchase,  
with community-driven customer support, making it ideal for self- 
suﬃcient customers who want to get something done immediately.

GTM motion 
● Low Touch: Aligns with event based marketing and a volume-based CS 
approach. It is  well suited for pro-users who at times require expert help.
● Medium Touch: Involves personalized sales and account-centric marketing. 
This touch level is versatile. Whether you're targeting a division within a large 
Enterprise or smaller company like an SMB, it's applicable.  
● High Touch: Designed for the mid-market or high-value customer segments, 
a High Touch approach involves custom marketing and deeply engaged CS 
teams. Imagine a 5,000-person company purchasing security software 
requiring in-depth guidance during the selection and activation phases.
● Dedicated Touch: Assembles a specialized team (often incorporating roles 
from product marketing to engineering) solely dedicated to a single client. 
For instance, consider a multifaceted account like Disney, which includes 
various divisions like ESPN and Disney Parks.
The touch-based GTM framework not only aligns marketing, sales, and CS but 
also harmonizes them. Think of it as assembling musicians playing different 
instruments into a symphony, all playing from the same music sheets. The 
framework provides the ﬂexibility to apply these synchronized GTM motions 
across various market segments and strategies.

Each GTM Motion Is Powered by a Different Engine
Applying different GTM motions offers clear advantages, enabling a company to 
reach various market segments. However, managing many different GTM 
motions simultaneously requires a diverse set of resources, akin to operating 
electrical and combustion engines in a single automotive ﬂeet.
As combustion and electrical engines operate on different principles, so do 
various GTM motions. Examining the “engine" behind different GTM motions, 
you'll ﬁnd different mechanisms drive them, each with unique characteristics 
and maintenance needs. This complexity makes it diﬃcult for any company to 
excel in multiple GTM motions simultaneously, much like a hybrid car might 
have both types of engines but won't achieve top speeds with either.
Consider a Medium Touch GTM motion similar to a combustion engine: it's 
versatile. Still, it demands specialized care—thought leadership, a steady ﬂow 
of quality content, and possibly an annual in-person customer event. 
Conversely, a Low Touch GTM motion could be likened to an electrical engine: 
less resource-intensive but highly speciﬁc, requiring different marketing 
campaigns and sales support. 
The contrasting needs and complexities of these engines make it challenging to 
easily switch between GTM motions, just as pivoting from a fossil fuel-based 
ﬂeet to an all-electric one would require careful planning and resource allocation. 
Therefore, addressing the interoperability of these different GTM motions from 
the start is crucial to prevent potential complications requiring a phase shift.
Example of the different engines each GTM motion is built around.TABLE 10.2

Maturity Stages of a GTM Motion
The  maturity stages we discuss here map back to the revenue factory we 
discussed in Chapter 1 (see Section 1.2.2):
● Maturity Stage 1–Scalability: 
Assesses a GTM motion's ability to handle increased demand through higher 
volume or improved throughput. Scalability hinges on the implementation of 
well-established and repeatable processes. If a GTM motion is scalable, it 
implies that by allocating additional resources, revenue can be scaled up 
effectively.
● Maturity Stage 2–Sustainability:
While a GTM motion may be scalable, it might not be sustainable if the costs 
of scaling—whether operational, marketing, or otherwise—exceed revenue 
growth. Sustainability evaluates if the generated revenue adequately covers 
the costs of customer acquisition and retention. 
Example: A company sells a solution with an ACV of $60,000. It uses a seller 
and sales engineer combo, costing the company $600,000 annually. They 
sell 10 solutions. It means that 100% of the ﬁrst-year revenue would go to 
pay for the acquisition, not accounting for other overheads like management, 
ops support, and marketing. It may be scalable, but this is not sustainable, a 
topic discussed in Section 10.4.
● Maturity Stage 3–Durability: 
At this stage, companies focus their most valuable resources on acquiring 
customers who derive signiﬁcant, long-term impact from your service. These 
customers will remain loyal over time. Durability focuses on recurring impact 
to meet the customer's current and future needs. It makes your product 
indispensable and integral to their long-term plans. Durability also means 
sellers are selective about which customers commit to, which requires a 
process for qualifying based on the potential for impact.  
During the Golden Era, an overﬂow of venture capital caused companies to focus 
solely on scaling, often overlooking sustainability.

Product-Led Growth 
Buyers continue to evolve, shaping their preferences for how they wish to be 
approached. In the past, the favored approach involved a salesperson physically 
visiting your location with product samples and demos. Today, this approach is 
commonly referred to as sales-led growth or SLG. However, in recent years, 
we've observed a shift towards PLG or Product-Led Growth, where customers 
interact with the product before engaging in the sales process. 
It has become evident that relying solely on PLG has limitations and can only 
propel companies to a certain point. As companies grow, they often set their 
sights on securing deals with large enterprises. This is where the concept of 
product-led sales comes into play. Product-led sales represent a powerful fusion 
of PLG and SLG, but it's important to emphasize that it all starts with a strong 
foundation in PLG.
10.1.8
Although startups and scaleups initially appeared mature regarding revenue, their 
GTM motions were stuck in the Scalability stage. CEOs equated business maturity 
with metrics such as the amount of ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue), the growth 
rate, or the size of the latest funding round. In essence, the GTM motion remained 
immature. Now that we have identiﬁed the problem, the solution is clear: shift 
towards Sustainability, a more cost-eﬃcient approach to growth that gained 
popularity in 2023.

What Sets PLG Apart?
The term "product-led growth" has become more than industry jargon; it's a pivot 
in how businesses approach their GTM. While we've looked at several GTM 
motions like Low Touch and Medium Touch models, PLG stands distinctively 
apart. As Dave Boyce aptly put it: "PLG is a GTM strategy whereby users 
experience the product before purchasing."
PLG distinguishes itself from others through its unwavering commitment to the 
user experience and actionable data rather than merely focusing on contracts and 
transactional engagements. This shift in perspective has become a cornerstone in 
the evolution of the GTM paradigm. Throughout this book, we have leaned on 
several elements to reshape how we view business growth. You will notice that 
PLG addresses all of these issues "out of the box."
● A Comprehensive GTM Approach: PLG isn't restricted to the early stages of 
a customer journey: It engages with customers from the ﬁrst touchpoint to 
customer success and beyond. This approach ensures that the impact is 
consistently delivered at every interaction, creating sustainable growth.
● Customer-Centric Impact: Where traditional GTM motions may be product- 
or even seller-centric, PLG is unambiguously customer-centric.  It's all about 
creating a measurable impact in the user’s life, thereby aligning a company's 
success with the user’s success.
● GTM Motion Interoperability: PLG promotes seamless transitions between 
different GTM motions. Whether it's an individual user who becomes part of 
a team or a team that evolves into an entire company, PLG facilitates growth 
at each stage. This capability enables businesses to navigate complex 
customer life cycles more effectively.
● Creation of an Operating Model: PLG doesn't discard the human element 
that high touch motion brings or the velocity driven by medium touch motion. 
Instead, it seeks to combine these advantages, creating a hybrid model 
where technology and human interaction coexist for maximum Impact.

C H A P T E R   1 0    |   G T M   M O D E L
● Closed-Loop Systems via Word of Mouth: Word-of-mouth advocacy is one 
of the most potent engines of PLG. A genuinely delighted customer becomes 
an advocate, helping to create a closed-loop system where new customers 
are continuously drawn into the ecosystem. This isn't just beneﬁcial for 
acquiring customers, but also in improving retention rates.
● Data-Driven Decision-Making: In PLG, data-driven decision-making extends 
beyond tracking conversion rates. Real-time, segmented usage data around 
feature adoption offers precise insights that can automate processes and 
facilitate A/B testing. In this context, data serves dual purposes: it's a metric 
for success and a roadmap for optimizing the user journey, reﬁning product 
features, and identifying upselling opportunities.
● Durable Growth: Without the forcing function of contracts, PLG gravitates to 
its best customers, shedding unﬁt customers early on. 
The point is this: PLG is a harbinger of what's possible when we apply its best 
practices across all GTM strategies. By doing so, we aren't just increasing 
scalability or sustainability; we're elevating the entire business model to new 
heights of customer satisfaction and operational excellence.
Channels
So far, we've been focusing on a direct customer approach. However, it's 
essential to understand that different sales channels, like resellers, strategic 
partners, and system integrators, play vital roles in distributing and selling 
products or services. Let's simplify the distinctions:
● Resellers: Resellers are intermediaries who market your solution to clients. 
They often represent a range of products, not just yours, which means they 
may lack a deep understanding of your speciﬁc offering. Nevertheless, they 
are crucial in helping you access a broader audience, particularly if they have 
an established customer base, perhaps in a region with a different language. 
The cost of a reseller can vary anywhere from 10% for a referral to >50% for a 
value-added reseller (VAR) that provides a direct sales force, an annual 
volume commitment, and performs the ﬁrst line of support.
10.1.9

## Page 399

C H A P T E R   1 0    |   G T M   M O D E L
● Strategic Partners work collaboratively to enhance the value of your 
product. These partners can provide complementary services or 
technologies that seamlessly align with your solution. Together, you 
create a more comprehensive offering for customers.
● Aﬃliates are partners or entities that promote products or services to 
other businesses in exchange for commissions. These aﬃliates can 
be individuals or companies that leverage their networks, content, or 
industry inﬂuence to drive sales or leads for another business. 
● System Integrators (SI) are experts in combining different solutions into a 
uniﬁed system. System integrators can open doors to industries or clients 
that require bespoke solutions, such as selling to the Department of 
Defense and meeting SOC or FISMA compliance standards.
To clarify, Resellers sell your product, Strategic partners collaborate to enhance 
it, Aﬃliates promote it, and System Integrators specialize in integrating it into 
intricate systems (see Figure 10.9). Different channels bring unique strengths to 
the table that can play a vital role at different stages of the customer journey. 
Note that channels can be applied to any functional block in the 5 GTM motions 
(see Figure 10.8).  
The application of different channels apply to different areas of the customer journey.FIGURE 10.9

In summary: The GTM model offers a uniﬁed framework that aligns marketing, 
sales, and customer success. Segmented by ACV and deal volume, this 
framework provides insights into which GTM motion will be more likely to 
succeed and how it should be executed. Companies can now differentiate 
between GTM motions for different products or employ multiple GTM motions 
for a single product. This approach helps with a uniform methodology, making it 
more cost-eﬃcient and allowing quick responses to market shifts.
It is a common misunderstanding to assume a linear relationship exists between 
the cost of different GTM motions. However, introducing human elements 
increases the cost with a factor ranging from 5x to 20x. It highlights the 
importance of continuing to evaluate the scalability and sustainability of GTM 
motions. It also explains the explosive demand for AI and its anticipated 
inﬂuence on GTM over the coming years.

Next, we will delve into practical use cases for these GTM motions, followed by 
the application of Growth Formulas to determine the unit economics of each 
motion, aiding in scalability. Furthermore, by assessing the costs, we can gauge 
long-term sustainability. Keep in mind that ultimately, your company’s growth is 
the sum of the outputs generated by multiple GTM motions working in unison.

PUTTING THE GTM MODEL TO WORK
Let's bring the GTM model to life with a few real-life examples. Suppose a 
company has been selling a SaaS solution with an average ACV of $7,000 to 
VSBs, targeting customers with 3 to 5 seats on average, and has achieved $45M 
in ARR. It is being told by its investors "to move upstream" and start "hunting for 
bigger deals." What should they do? What is the most suitable GTM motion for 
them?

The right GTM motion for a product with an ACV of $7,000 is a Low Touch motion.FIGURE 10.11
What Did We Learn? 
At $45M in ARR, a single GTM motion at an ACV of $7,000 would take over 6,400 
customers and probably gain a thousand new B2B commitments a year to 
thrive. Using the GTM model shows they should implement a Low Touch GTM 
motion with a PLG front end. In other words, get sign-ups via the web, convert 
those sign-ups post-trial, and then focus on expansion. A critical part of this 
strategy is maintaining high retention; the company must ensure that customers 
get the desired impact out of the product.

Equally important is identifying what won't work. For instance, when we look  at 
the GTM model, it clearly shows there's no need for a ﬁeld sales team with 
high-cost sellers or ﬂoors ﬁlled with inside sellers (SDRs), for that matter. As 
straightforward as this seems, GTM executives are known to stray from this 
path. This can be due to investor pressure, advice from false prophets, hiring   
a new executive with speciﬁc expertise in a particular GTM motion, or an 
impulsive decision triggered by buying a new tool and following a new industry 
trend. In this case, the GTM model acts as a guide; it shows: "This is the GTM 
motion you should use; now, why do you think your situation is different?"  
Let’s step through a series of in-real-life use cases to better understand how 
the GTM model works:
● Use-case 1: Use of Multiple GTM Motions (10.2.1)
● Use-case 2: Everything. Everywhere. All at Once. (10.2.2)
● Use-case 3: Use of a Trendline (10.2.3)
● Use-case 4: When NRR Conﬂicts with ACV (10.2.4)
● Use-case 5: The Odd Couple: PLG and Enterprise (10.2.5)
● Use-case 6: Evolution of the GTM model (10.2.6)
Let’s start with the use of multiple GTM motions.
Use-case 1: Use of Multiple GTM Motions
This approach aligns with the following guidance on the number of GTM 
models: focus on at most 3 GTM motions until you reach $50M in ARR, and 
then introduce a new product to break the $100M barrier. For example:
● High Touch GTM: A ﬁeld sales team focused on Enterprise sales with ACVs 
ranging from $150,000 to $500,000, often aided by a sales engineer and, in 
most cases, an executive.
● Medium Touch GTM: To manage a large inﬂux of inbound leads spurred by 
its growing popularity, they deployed an inside sales organization composed 
of several SDRs/AEs.
10.2.1

>$1M
● Dedicated Touch GTM: The company had secured contracts with several 
F2000 companies, including 2 world-leading airlines. For example, they 
assigned dedicated account managers to these airlines, each contributing 
several million dollars in annual ARR.
This doesn't mean that just because the company surpassed $50M, it can 
deploy unlimited GTM motions. As discussed in Chapter 8, The Operating 
Model, complexities will emerge when multiple GTM motions are in play. You 
will soon grapple with varied terminologies, inconsistent data structures, and a 
myriad of tools. Such lack of uniformity will drive up costs quickly, underscoring 
the importance of implementing an Operating Model.
What Did We Learn? 
Deploying an Operating Model is necessary when you operate more than one 
GTM motion. The lack of an operating model will impact the entire organization's 
performance. The introduction of an operating model takes a phase shift, and as 
previously discussed, these phase shifts often take at least one, if not two, years 
to complete. With a second GTM motion often kicking in around $10M in ARR, 
an operating model is needed much earlier than anticipated.

Use-case 2: Everything, Everywhere, All at Once
Much like the chaotic, multi-dimensional narrative of the movie Everything, 
Everywhere, All at Once, this GTM approach creates a complex landscape that 
is hard to navigate. Popular among companies that have been in business for 
more than 7 years, who experienced staff turnover. They have many different 
GTM elements doing a little bit of everything, but none of it very well. While this 
all-over-the-place mess might be captivating on the big screen, it's far less 
effective in a GTM approach.
The Problem: Incoherent Strategy Increases the Cost to Serve
A lack of alignment is commonplace, especially in companies with an ARR of 
$20–50 million. Within these organizations, departments like marketing, sales, 
and customer success often operate in silos. Marketing focuses on generating 
opportunities in one area, sales aim to close deals in another, and customer 
success is held accountable for metrics over which they have little control.
This disjointed approach originates from various factors. New leadership may 
introduce divergent methodologies, departments might function 
autonomously—leading to misalignment—or the distraction of the latest "shiny 
tools" shifts focus away from core objectives. Above all, ownership is absent. 
The CRO typically zeroes in on growth metrics, while a founder/CEO with no 
commercial background leaves no one accountable for uniting the teams under 
a singular, long-term objective. To paint a clearer picture, consider an example 
where a $120,000 ACV solution is being sold (see Figure 10.13):
● A centrally executed ABS campaign targeting 100 of the largest companies.
● SDRs draft their own email cadences.
● Junior sellers, lacking domain knowledge, reach out to CxO-level decision- 
makers.
● Helpdesk support falls short of the expected 24/7 Enterprise-level service.
● A chatbot on the website routes valuable leads to whoever is available. Often, 
to the least qualiﬁed person, the SDR.

Use-case 3: Use of a Trendline 
In late 2021, we were pulled into a project with $40M+ in ARR, selling a CRM 
solution to VSBs. They successfully used a Low Touch GTM motion and had 
7,000+ customers. The ACV trended from $6,225 to $7,111 over 3 quarters, but 
NRR was painfully at 96%. Some customers were churning, while others doubled 
down on the product. 
To reinvigorate growth, they were going to invest in 2 areas: i) Generate pipeline 
in SMB using a Medium Touch GTM motion by hiring SDRs and AEs. And ii) Win 
big deals by going "whale hunting" in the Enterprise market using one of their top 
sellers and hire a team of enterprise sales reps; in other words, launch a high 
touch GTM motion. 
This strategy is not just ineffective; it's wasteful. It often stems from a "let the 
customer decide how to buy" mentality. While this might be acceptable if it were 
an intentional experiment within given time constraints, when implemented 
haphazardly, it creates a scenario no one wants to be part of.
What Did We Learn? 
Focus on what works, and stop pursuing GTM motions that don't work. 
Reallocate all available resources to GTM motions that are proving successful.

Their venture partner was worried about this and brought us in to validate this 
big move. We used the GTM model and plotted a trendline for their current GTM 
motion (Figure 10.14), which conﬁrmed our suspicion that they were indeed 
operating under the appropriate GTM motion. The chart debunked the viability 
of the other GTM motions.

Based on this, we recommended the following:
● Retain: Invest in your customer success team to drive meaningful 
customer impact. Build a user community, share best practices, 
offer workﬂow examples, and conduct workshops.
● Expand: Launch a new product (a customer success offering).
● Acquire More Eﬃciently: Focus on acquiring faster. Optimize your 
VSB operations by eliminating ineﬃciencies in the signup process 
and enabling quicker launches—measured in minutes, not hours.

This is an application of second-order thinking: simply hoping another GTM 
motion will solve the issue is not a sound strategy, so always identify the root 
causes of impeding growth before planning a new one.

Use-case 4: When NRR Conﬂicts with ACV
A few years ago, we were approached by a customer who said they had 
watched every video, read all the books, and implemented everything 
accordingly, yet exclaimed on a call, "It doesn't work?" They had an ACV of 
$40,000 and had hired a team of SDRs and AEs to target DataOps executives. 
Using their founder, they gained about 80 customers and expected another 80 
within a year by launching a professional sales team.
The Problem: Looking at the NRR, They Picked the Wrong GTM Motion 
We were intrigued when they mentioned having SDRs call on DataOps 
executives. We later discovered that their NRR was staggering, taking the 
software from a $40,000 ﬁrst-year cost to $107,200 in the second year and 
$264,784 in the third—a total of over $411,984. Their mistake was basing their 
GTM motion on the initial ACV, ignoring that, based on the ACV over 3 years, it 
needed a high touch motion. Therefore, the solution was simple: replace the 
SDR/AE team with an experienced seller and a sales engineer. 
What Did We Learn? 
Consider the ﬁrst-year ACV in the context of the revenue over the next 2 to 3 
years by including the NRR in your decision. Moreover, the switcheroo from 
one GTM motion to another took 2 years and cost over $10 million; that's a lot 
of lost time that is hard to recoup.

Use-case 5: The Odd Couple, PLG and Enterprise 
Atlassian broke new ground by leveraging a unique PLG strategy for software 
developers and using a bottom-up sales model, free trials, and low-cost plans for 
individual Users or small teams. This approach sidesteps the need for executive 
buy-in, making adoption more seamless. Once hooked, the Users become 
Champions of the product within their organizations, acting as marketers, sales 
reps, and sales engineers. As the user base expands, a more traditional payment 
model kicks in. Atlassian's focus on self-serve options, transparent pricing, and 
customer-centricity has made this GTM approach, often referred to as a PLG 
motion, remarkably effective. Many others have attempted to emulate this, but 
only some have succeeded. Many companies still struggle to make it work. Let's 
explain how this use case works.
The Problem: It's Not Product-Led Growth; It’s Developer-Led Growth 
Years of experience with top PLG companies have shown that the magic of 
Atlassian's model is realizing its developer-led growth. Unlike basic PLG models 
that target individual users—think Superhuman or Calendly—developer platforms 
necessitate the collaboration of multiple developers. The developers' behavior and 
culture—valuing skill and tenure over managerial authority— ultimately dictate the 
GTM motion's success.
The conversion timeline from a pro-user to a small team or from a small team to 
a larger group is gradual, often spanning months or even years. This extended 
gestation period is not a bug but a feature. When a developer completes a project 
or transitions to a new job, it is the best time to switch to a new tool stack. 
Providers who understand and embrace this concept invest years in cultivating 
this culture, establishing an insurmountable competitive advantage.
Moreover, the developer-led growth motion seamlessly blends the low-, mid-, and 
high-touch models, naturally creating a uniﬁed Operating Model (see Figure 
10.16). This establishes a ﬂuid user journey, from initial contact to high-value 
transactions under one strategic umbrella. This approach sets a new benchmark 
for harmonizing multiple GTM motions.

What Did We Learn? 
In developer platforms, PLG should be seen as developer-led growth. It isn't a 
high-velocity lead generation strategy using a freemium model or a sales 
methodology to close deals faster; it must be seen as an investment in a 
long-term, highly sophisticated GTM motion. 
Evolution of the GTM Model
The evolution of the GTM Model is dynamic, as it continuously adjusts to 
market conditions. It's crucial to understand that the buyer determines how they 
want to be catered to. It means the GTM model responds and evolves to 
customer trends across marketing, sales, and customer success. And that it is 
constantly evolving.
GTM Motion Trends
In the Golden Era of SaaS, the market underwent rapid transformations, and 
various trends emerged, often propelled by groundbreaking technological 
innovations. Given the industry's history of seismic changes, we can reasonably 
expect another evolution in the near term, mainly due to advances in AI and the 
impact it will have on all GTM motions.

Trend 1–Evolving SEO Landscape: The landscape of SEO is transforming 
signiﬁcantly, and we start with this trend as it impacts all GTM motions. 
● Search Engine Optimization (SEO): Ideally, organic traﬃc accounts for 
greater than 40% of a website's total traﬃc. Yet, many SaaS companies 
today see less than 20% due to profound changes in Search Engine 
Results Pages (SERPs). Previously, keyword ranking was central to driving 
traﬃc and conversions, but this approach is no longer suﬃcient. The 
traditional focus on speciﬁc methodologies and channels (SEO, PPC, 
Social) has evolved into a complex multi-touch media attribution model. 
There are many nuances to SEO to consider; for example, auto-complete 
and suggestive search phrases signiﬁcantly impact user search behavior, 
offering distinct results from traditional natural language searches.
● Content: Today, engagement is driven by thought leadership and quality 
content, requiring adaptations to how and where people search and the 
kind of content they ﬁnd valuable. Video content, notably on YouTube, has 
become increasingly important in search results, while most B2B 
organizations lack the skill of doing video well. 
AI-generated searches challenge content creators to stay relevant and 
objective, emphasizing transparency over sales-driven narratives. This shift 
underscores the renewed importance of press releases, which necessitate 
strategic placements in leading trade sites for the legitimacy of the content 
and the establishment of powerful inbound links.
Moreover, using content distribution platforms like TikTok and Instagram 
illustrates the necessity to engage audiences with shorter attention spans, 
indicating a shift towards more dynamic and accessible content formats.
As the SEO landscape evolves, the implications for content strategy, audience 
engagement, and digital marketing approaches are profound. Companies like 
Adobe, Canva, and Grammarly leveraging TikTok for advertising underscore the 
need for SaaS companies to adopt innovative and responsive SEO strategies.

The No Touch GTM motion is moving to serve higher ACV ranges, signaling a shift 
towards more scalable, cost-eﬃcient models.
FIGURE 10.17
Next are 3 trends that affect the no touch/low touch GTM motions:
● Trend 2–Inbound Marketing is Unable to Sustain the Growth: Inbound 
marketing, a core element of SaaS GTM for over a decade, is now under 
pressure due to market saturation. With generative AI poised to inundate the 
market with a lot of content, standing out has become more challenging for 
companies relying heavily on this approach.
● Trend 3–Conversational Marketing is being Powered by AI: Since 2018, 
conversational marketing has been reshaping the Low Touch GTM motion by 
integrating AI-driven chatbots. The development of AI will help chat bots 
become more nuanced and have more context-aware dialogues with clients, 
substantially enhancing automated customer interactions.

● Trend 4–The Evolution of PLG: PLG's customer-centric focus increasingly 
puts the product at the helm of business growth, causing scalable and 
sustainable growth. While PLG historically accelerated growth at a reduced 
cost of sales, the marketing and customer success expenses have remained 
substantial. AI is poised to further revolutionize PLG by reducing these costs 
and improving the post-sales customer experience. PLG will continue to 
follow how customers want to buy, guiding other GTM motions toward more 
scalable and sustainable growth.
Medium Touch Trends: This particular GTM motion was popularized by 
innovations in email automation (sequencing). In short, it will see a narrower 
application. The transformation is fueled by the increase in the cost of human 
resources (see Figure 1.11), which is balanced with advances in AI replacing 
these resources. AI will also improve the outreach based on insights available 
through widely available data, enabling unprecedented customization and 
targeting on a large scale. Whereas the low touch motion leverages users to 
create word of mouth, the mid touch uses thought leaders to present their 
approach at industry events. Two trends reshaping the medium touch GTM 
motion are: 
● Trend 5–Outbound Has Reached Saturation: Between 2016 and 2020, 
outbound was one of the default GTM motions used as the Mid Touch 
motion. Initially thriving with email automation and hyper-personalization 
outbound via phone, email, and inmail has reached saturation with a sharp 
decline in response rates. Despite this, we can expect AI-powered techniques 
to continue playing a signiﬁcant role in customer marketing spaces.
● Trend 6–The Verticalization of Inside Sales Teams: Inside sales teams 
have been integral to medium touch GTM, typically consisting of SDRs and 
AEs. PLG and PLS will narrow the ﬁeld of application of this speciﬁc GTM 
motion. We will see inside sales ﬁnd new life in vertical SaaS markets, which 
will beneﬁt from a highly personalized outreach.

It is true that today's oversized SDR teams are likely to downsize, but expect 
an increase in focus on more experienced staff with deep market 
knowledge—for example, think of former teachers calling on schools and 
former nurses calling on hospitals.
Next, we will look at the trends in the high/dedicated touch GTM motions.
High/Dedicated Touch GTM Motion Trends
Contrary to the notion that online and inside sales would eclipse the high touch 
motion, it is making a big comeback. As more technology is used and AI leaves 
us wondering who we are talking to, the ability to talk to a real person who has 
lived it will become of premium value.
● Trend 7–Product-Led Sales (PLS): PLS is the sibling of PLG, where a 
sales-led motion is tightly aligned with PLG. Who has been using the product, 
what features, what was the user experience, and what impact did the user 
get out of it? It brings the product (and user) into a more complex, 
multi-stakeholder decision process. The user's increased role in the decision 
process must be codiﬁed in modern sales processes; an example of this is 
depicted in Figure 8.21.

● Trend 8–Expanding Role of In-Person Selling: The High Touch sales model, 
traditionally the realm of "road warriors" closing million-dollar deals, is 
becoming cost-effective, even for smaller deals ($30,000). 
Moving forward, In-Person is no longer conﬁned to sales; customer success 
teams can embrace this engaging approach, too. Expect more regional 
events to build local customer communities that share best practices.
Coupled with the ever-increasing price of subscription services, expect High 
Touch sales and dedicated CS reps to move toward mainstream use.
● Trend 9–Resurgence of Regional Teams: On the backs of the increasing role 
of in-person selling, localized teams covering major metropolitan areas like 
New York, London, and Singapore are making a comeback. These small, 
region-speciﬁc oﬃces aren't just about sales; they're becoming hubs for 
building an in-region community.
● Trend 10–The Hyper-Specialist Era: The customer's demand for nuanced 
insights drives demand for subject-matter experts from R&D, not just in sales 
but also in marketing, and customer success efforts.
Foundational Principles of Trends in GTM Motions
The vast array of trends in GTM motions can seem daunting, yet understanding 
their cyclical nature is essential. At their heart, GTM motions are anchored by 
foundational principles (see Table 10.2). Unveiling these underlying principles 
reveals speciﬁc needs that drive a constant evolution of these trends.
● No touch needs a high volume of leads: This approach demands a high 
transaction volume and prioritizes cost-eﬃciency. It employs content-driven 
inbound marketing to engage a broad audience, fostering word-of-mouth, 
which explains why PLG works so well here.
● Low touch needs a high velocity of sales and expansion: This strategy is 
deﬁned by the rapid pace of transactions and a focus on accelerating 
customer growth. It explains the use of SDRs to qualify buyers to setting up 
the seller to perform a "disco-demo-close." It also explains the popularity of 
industry events and a market rife with self-anointed thought leaders.

● High Touch needs a brand build on expertise: Tailored for CxO-level 
decision-making, this approach requires deep level of expertise, demands 
signiﬁcant technical support throughout the customer’s lifetime, and may 
even involve a level of customization. Cultivating a trusted relationship is 
essential, which causes a happy customer to refer new customers.
These trends demonstrate that the GTM motions are constantly moving within 
the GTM model. They're ﬂuid and must be revisited and revised to match the 
ever-changing business landscape. 
With the Golden Era in the rearview mirror, we know it's not just about scalable 
GTM motions anymore. The grow at all costs mindset of the past decade led to 
companies avoiding due diligence to determine what GTM motions would work 
best. Companies instead used the funds provided by a venture partner to deploy 
many different GTM motions. As we learned, this makes it costly and creates a 
culture where growth staggers due to the resources being spread thinly over too 
many GTM motions. Today, we have entered a new era, that of the revenue 
factory, in which each GTM motion operates like a production line. Each GTM 
motion, much like a production line, provides scalability (growth velocity), 
sustainability (cost-eﬃciency), and durability (high quality). 
In the process, we learned from successful PLG motions that they reﬂect critical 
elements any GTM motion needs to address to succeed:
● Help the customer to buy. The company selling is, therefore, a result. 
● Help customers use of your product successfully: thereby achieving impact.
● Create interoperability between different GTM motions to be more eﬃcient..
Conclusion: Gone are the days when GTM strategies were based on gut 
feelings or industry buzz. Today, we're in an era of data-driven decision- 
making. By leveraging real-time metrics, we can scientiﬁcally evaluate 
different GTM approaches. The move to data-centricity isn't just an upgrade; 
it's a game-changer. It empowers us to make well-informed decisions, trading 
guesswork for quantiﬁable insights, which is the key to unlocking scalable and 
sustainable growth.

The goal of the Revenue Factory is to achieve Durable Growth, which means 
winning customers who help you grow revenue quickly and cost-eﬃciently. 
These customers can be identiﬁed as those who achieve the desired impact. 
In the context of high-velocity growth, we approach this by splitting growth 
into 3 maturity phases, each focusing on a speciﬁc area:
Phase 1. Scalability = Growth with a focus on Velocity Scalability 
emphasizes the velocity of growth, where 'velocity' refers to the alignment 
between the product and the chosen GTM motion. For instance, the 
velocity increases when aligned, as seen with Slack's adoption of a PLG 
motion.  This phase leverages all available resources and opportunities 
without prioritizing eﬃciency. It is characterized by a drive to rapidly 
increase revenue, relying on the business's ability to invest signiﬁcant 
capital in generating and developing leads in a brand-new market. The 
goal is to transform these leads into customers who have the potential to 
increase revenues signiﬁcantly over the years to come.
Phase 2. Sustainability = Scalable Growth + a focus on Cost: Builds 
upon scalability by integrating eﬃciency. Resources are becoming 
ﬁnite, and as a result, an unchecked focus on scalable growth leads to 
unsustainable resource demands. Thus, sustainable growth balances 
growth velocity with resource optimization, ensuring long-term viability 
without overextending the business's capabilities.
Phase 3. Durability = Sustainable Growth + a focus on Quality: 
Represents the pinnacle of growth evolution, building on the principles 
of scalability and sustainability while emphasizing quality. In durable 
growth, quality is paramount, focusing on delivering a recurring impact 
to customers. Happy customers stay loyal, expand their business, and 
become advocates, aiding new customer acquisition. Consequently, 
growth is achieved more cost-effectively, propelling the system forward 
in a manner that is both eﬃcient and effective.
In the following sections, we unpack the strategies and tactics necessary to 
propel the GTM motions toward achieving lasting growth.

SCALABILITY OF A GTM MOTION
Chapter 4 delved into how GTM motions function like systems with inputs and 
outputs. This simpliﬁed perspective reveals that there are 2 primary approaches 
to achieving revenue scalability:
● Increasing Inputs (quantity), think of adding more leads, 
● Improving Throughput (quality), think of improving conversion rates.
To determine the impact of each we will use the Growth Formula.
Understanding Scalability
Let's start with a practical use-case: a Low Touch Inbound GTM motion, depicted 
in the next ﬁgure. The journey starts with 8,422 monthly website visitors (VM1). Of 
these visitors, 8% (CR1) take action by signing up for more content. This 
engagement produces 673 leads, providing an opportunity to nurture them with 
additional content and events. As their engagement deepens, 7% (CR2) express 
interest in having a conversation, leading to 47 opportunities (VM3). Of these 
opportunities, 67% (CR3) are deemed a ﬁt, and with help from the sales team, 20% 
(CR4) commit to a purchase, with an average discount of 22%. Based on a list 
price of $24,000, this results in a new ARR of $118,308 per month (VM6).

The growth of recurring revenue from $118,308 to $626,225 involves multiple 
factors that affect the revenue of a cohort of customers over time. A detailed 
breakdown is necessary to accurately calculate the annual growth percentage 
attributable to retention and expansion. The breakdown in the next table 
illustrates an in real life customer example of how retention and expansion rates 
contribute to the year-over-year revenue ﬁgures, accumulating over 5 years.

The compounding effect of revenue through retention and expansionTABLE 10.4
The Growth Formula represents a sequence of conversions and activities 
leading to revenue growth. It aids in understanding the cause-and-effect 
relationship between different stages of customer acquisition and retention and 
can aid in comparing different GTM motions. The Growth Formula helps derive 
unit economics, which is essential for comprehending the cost and revenue 
generated per unit of input (such as leads or visitors) or unit of output (like 
revenue). For instance, utilizing this Growth Formula, we can deduce that this 
particular GTM motion yields $14,407 in revenue for every 1,000 visitors. 
1,000  / 8,422 ྾  $118,308 = $14,407 in ARR(new)FORMULA 10-1
$1,000,000  / $118,308 ྾  8,422  = 71,186 visitorsFORMULA 10-2
Or it takes 71,186 visitors to generate $1M in new ARR, assuming the quality of 
visitors and, thereby, their conversion into revenue stays the same.

Scalability: Increasing the Input
During the Golden Era, the market was brimming with opportunity, reminiscent 
of human's "hunter-gatherer" period. This period was a time in which humanity 
could thrive by simply foraging for plentiful, naturally replenishing food sources 
without the need for farming. Scaling was akin to having more people forage.
From 2015 to 2021, scaling a recurring revenue business followed a similar 
principle: all you had to do was increase the number of leads (inputs) to amplify 
growth (output). Think of boosting SEO/SEM spend, hiring more sales reps 
(SDRs/ AEs), and applying state-of-the-art tools. A time in which VCs would ask, 
"If we double your round, can you grow twice as fast?"  It was an era marked by 
a linear mindset—in that 2x growth resulted from 2x inputs.
The landscape has since shifted, with many facing a scarcity of inputs. Take an 
outbound GTM motion as an example: In 2021, a list of 500 targeted accounts 
paired with an email automation tool might have yielded a 10% open rate and a 
12% click-through rate, converting to 5 opportunities and resulting in 1 win (see 
Figure 10.20). However, by 2024, outbound conversion rates had deteriorated, 
requiring many more targeted attempts to generate the same number of 
opportunities. The substantial increase in inputs and a steep rise in the unit cost 
per input caused Lead Generation cost to catapult.
Companies reliant on input-based scaling, such as vertical SaaS, must track the 
amount of leads needed to generate a single deal, as well as the cost per input,  
vigilantly. These are clear signs that scalability based on volume of inputs is 
drawing to a close, and that you need to shift to throughput based scalability.

Scalability: Improving the Throughput
Scalable growth is often seen as the result of increasing the number of inputs, 
such as leads. It leads GTM teams to believe that increasing growth requires 
boosting the volume of inputs, e.g. more leads. However, as demonstrated by 
the Medium Touch GTM motion depicted in the previous ﬁgure, a marginal 
decline in lead quality necessitated a fourfold increase in the number of leads 
to sustain the same revenue levels. Thus, a decrease in conversion metrics 
impacted the quantity of inputs needed. Conversely, an increase in conversion 
metrics will lead to an increase in revenue. This strategy is known as 
Throughput Improvement. Conversion rates are dynamic; they change. By 
establishing a trendline and comparing it to industry benchmarks, we can 
assess whether there is room for improvement. For example, a lead capture 
rate might dwindle by only 0.25 percentage points per quarter. However, its 
persistent decline eventually causes it to fall well below benchmark data, 
signaling a signiﬁcant issue. When such a trend occurs across multiple 
metrics simultaneously, it serves as a clarion call for immediate action.

Instead of a disproportionate increase on a single metric, such as doubling the 
number of leads, marginal theory, detailed in section 7.1.2, examines what 
happens if multiple metrics are improved simultaneously. For example:. 
● Download [CR1 8% > 10%]: Reduce the number of entry ﬁelds, bringing it 
doesn to just the email address for example.
● Interested [CR2 7% > 8%]: Use technology to cross-reference intent data 
and focus on higher-value prospects.
● Qualiﬁed [CR3 67% > 70%]: Provide compelling reasons for prospects to 
join a discovery call, such as unveiling new research, while improving the 
skills needed for effective discovery calls.
● Win rate [CR4 20% > 22%]: Invest in skill development in key areas, such 
as navigating the decision-making process.
● Discount [CR5 22% > 18%]: Train the team to trade rather than negotiate 
and require executive approval for discounts above 10%.
● Retention [CR7 95% > 96%]: Inform the customer of the impact delivered 
when it occurs, and provide frequent summaries to management.
● Expansion [CR8 108.8% > 110%]: Invite customers with the biggest 
expansion opportunity to a speciﬁc session on how to achieve growth.
When we apply this marginal gain to the Growth Formula, as depicted in the 
next table, the results show that the same number of visitors (VM1) increases 
the ARRnew  (VM6) from $118,308 to $204,198—a 72% increase. The gains 
extend  to acquisition to retention and expansion, resulting in a boost in revenue

The Next Generation of Growth 
We are witnessing the awe-inspiring capability of the recurring revenue 
propulsion system built into every subscription service. When operated as 
designed, it unlocks hyper-growth potential through marginal improvements, 
paving the way for scalable growth. Scalability manifests itself in 2 ways:
● Input Driven: Increasing the number of inputs results in growth. However, 
this can only be done for a while; at some point, the quality of the inputs will 
deteriorate, affecting conversion metrics and causing the need for an 
increasing amount of inputs, resulting in a decreasing output.
● Throughput Driven: Growth depends not just on the number of inputs but 
also on the quality. This is reﬂected by a series of conversion points at 
various stages along the customer journey. An earmark of throughput 
improvement is that it leads to cumulative effects, where marginal gains in 
each conversion point impacts the next conversion, and the next. Etcetera.
Three Ways to Improve Throughput 
During the 'Grow at all costs' era, our primary focus was on growth by increasing 
leads (inputs), for which it leveraged technology such as email automation. Over 
time, this led to a decline in the quality of inputs, adversely affecting conversion 
metrics and causing the system to collapse. As we enter a new era, our focus 
shifts toward Throughput Improvement, in which we aim to achieve marginal 
gains, not just in one function but across the entire customer journey. There are 3 
ways to improve Throughput:
● Streamlining processes by eliminating unnecessary steps,
● Automating systems with cutting-edge technology, such as AI,
● Enhancing skills through training, supported by in-person coaching.
At ﬁrst, it may seem far-fetched that these marginal gains can lead to such a big 
impact. But ask yourself: Is asking individual functions to aim for a 10% 
improvement reasonable? It seems feasible for a GTM organization to achieve 
this when it starts to work together as a team, use a common language, and 
implement a standardized approach. Isn't this precisely what professional sports 
teams do? And isn't it time we do the same for GTM?

The Crucial Role of the Growth Formula
Determining the scalability of a GTM motion remains a judgment call. However 
utilizing a Growth Formula and deriving unit economics from it aids those in 
charge of revenue operations in several ways:
● It highlights causality within the business operations.
● It identiﬁes assumptions through measurable metrics.
● It establishes reasonable expectations for teams based on these metrics.
● It enables an organization to monitor progress and identify bottlenecks.
It is clear that targeting incremental improvements across various departments 
is more feasible than expecting a single department to drive signiﬁcant change.
According to Theorem of Margin, even minor changes in one conversion metric 
(CR[n]) should prompt the GTM team to pay close attention and monitor 
developments rigorously. A simultaneous shift in 2 metrics compounds their 
effects, necessitating heightened vigilance. A change in 3 metrics signals an "all 
hands on deck" scenario, requiring immediate action regardless of whether the 
situation is rapidly improving or deteriorating.
This underscores the importance of the use of a Growth Formula to quantify the 
impact of marginal changes accurately. While it may initially seem complex, 
comprehending the causality between conversion points and their compounded 
impact on growth is essential. Scalability means that GTM motions are capable 
of managing ﬂuctuations in input volumes—such as leads or visitors—and 
generating increased outputs, like revenue, all without necessitating large 
resource increases or compromising existing processes. 
Throughout this book, we've drawn analogies to a factory, highlighting the 
transformative impact of the third industrial revolution, marked by the advent of 
robots that revolutionized manufacturing through scalability and eﬃciency. As 
we enter the fourth industrial revolution, fueled by advancements in AI and 
Large Language Models (LLM), the potential for signiﬁcant enhancements in 
GTM—particularly in terms of scalability and eﬃciency—becomes unmistakable. 
This technological progress promises a substantial leap forward and 
underscores the evolving landscape of GTM strategies in the new age.

SUSTAINABILITY IN GTM MOTIONS
Scalable growth focuses on expanding inputs, such as increasing lead ﬂow 
(VM2), and enhancing throughput, illustrated by improved conversion rates, like 
win rate (CR4). We employ the Growth Formula to articulate this concept. 
Sustainable growth extends scalable growth by adding a critical factor: Cost.
Each of the 7 stages of the Bowtie model incurs speciﬁc costs. We can organize 
the 7 cost centers with the origins of growth:
● Acquisition Cost: Covers the costs accumulated across the stages of 
Awareness, Education, and Selection (10.4.1).
● Retention Cost: Accounts for the one-time cost during onboarding and the 
ongoing costs to ensure adoption (10.4.2).
● Expansion Cost: Refers to the cost incurred during Expansion, including upsell 
and cross-sell (10.4.3).
A more accurate cost assessment is needed as the difference in cost across 
GTM motions between low-touch and high-touch motions can differ by a factor 
of 10x to 100x. Calculating the cost of a GTM motion involves examining 
role-speciﬁc salaries and allocating marketing expenses to each GTM motion. 
This approach contrasts with conventional CAC calculations, which evaluates 
costs on a much broader, departmental level.

In the Data Hierarchy depicted in Figure 9.19, the acquisition cost per GTM 
motion operates at Layer 3, whereas 'CAC' operates at Layer 4. A higher 
precision in the cost calculation is vital for conducting scenario analyses, which 
can highlight a narrow path to sustainable revenue growth over a prolonged and 
treacherous period. Currently, most decisions do not examine growth and cost 
trends per GTM motion, which is a root cause of unsustainable growth. By 
grounding investment decisions in scenario analysis that entails growth and 
cost per GTM motion, organizations better understand their venture's scalability 
and sustainability trends for years to come.
The Financial Planning and Analysis (FP&A) team plays a crucial in performing 
scenario analysis. Their responsibility is to provide you with insights on how to 
grow rapidly while eﬃciently using the available resources, across acquisition, 
retention, and expansion. 
Cost of Acquisition
Let’s delve into a practical example based on a medium-touch GTM motion. This 
motion attracts 50,000 visitors a year, of which 8% seek more information. These 
are referred to as leads. In this example, the following costs are incurred:
● The cost of attracting visitors, and converting them into a lead (CR1) is $25 
per lead for 4,000 leads per year, totaling $100,000 in lead generation costs.
● The cost of developing a lead (CR2) is based on the salary of a Sales 
Development Rep (SDR) who has an OTE of $60,000 per year.
● Once an opportunity is qualiﬁed (CR3), a seller (AE) secures 40 deals per year 
with an average win rate (CR4) of 21%. The OTE for an AE is $150,000.
It results in $748,500 against a target of $750,000 in ARRNEW per year. The 
total cost of acquisition is $310,000, or 41% of the ﬁrst-year revenue (see 
Figure 10.24). While such a percentage would be considered excessive in an 
ownership-based model, for a recurring revenue business, it may be justiﬁed, 
as the revenue has the potential to grow over the subsequent years. Each 
renewal will further the amortization of the acquisition costs.

Let’s conduct a scenario analysis on the above GTM motion, simulating a 
downturn causing a marginal decline in throughput performance across the 
board. As shown in the following ﬁgure, this causes the revenue to drop from 
$748,500 to $400,756, a 46% decrease. With the number of leads diminishing, 
the price per lead rises due to supply and demand dynamics. Fortunately, the 
SDR and Seller roles are on a variable compensation plan, with 50% guaranteed 
and 50% reliant on performance. This reduces the acquisition cost from 
$310,000 to $247,843, achieving a total cost reduction of approximately 20%.

Adding the cost to a Growth Formula for a GTM motion provides insight into the  
sustainability. In this case it takes $310,000 to generate $748,500 in ARRNEW .
FIGURE 10.24

As the performance marginally decreases the 50/50 variable compensation does not 
impact the cost proportionally. It now takes $247,843 to generate $400,756 in ARRNEW .

$27.50/lead = $86,625 SDR OTE = $46,062 Seller OTE = $115,156 Total = $247,843
LEAD GENERATION LEAD DEVELOPMENT SELLING ARRNEW
But herein lies the problem: this decline in revenue by 46% is far steeper 
than the ~20% decline in the cost of acquisition. The discrepancy causes  
the acquisition cost to soar from 41% to 62% of the ﬁrst year's revenue. 
A bellwether metric in this is the number of qualiﬁed opportunities an SDR 
generates. During the Golden Era, this ﬁgure ranged between 20 and 25 
opportunities per month, aligning with the example in Figure 10.24. Over 
time this has dropped to below 10 per month, demanding 2x the amount of 
lead generation and development efforts causing these costs to skyrocket.

Cost of Retention
Historically, the Cost to Serve (CTS) was employed to account for the expenses 
associated with customer service in an ownership-based model, where costs 
were covered up front. It primarily included installation assistance, bug ﬁxes, and 
account management, with a notable focus on password resets. Consequently, 
according to accounting principles (GAAP), Customer Service is classiﬁed under 
the Cost of Goods Sold (COGS). As discussed throughout this textbook, 
customer success in subscription- or consumption-based business models 
differ. 
In these models, it's crucial to help customers establish a recurring impact to 
retain their business—not just once but over a prolonged period. According to 
GAAP , Onboarding and Retention costs are accounted for under the Cost of 
Goods Sold (COGS). In contrast, costs associated with Expansion, such as 
upselling and cross-selling, are categorized under Sales and Marketing 
expenses. The allocation of costs, in line with accounting principles, causes the 
distinction between the cost of retention and expansion.
Let’s sit down with the FP&A team and establish the:
● Onboarding Costs: In this example, an Onboarder with a salary of $100,000 
per year onboards 40 accounts a month or 480 a year. This boils down to 
around $203 per account for onboarding. It may not be important for an 
account that generates $18,000 in revenue annually, but this would be a 
non-starter for an account that generates $60 in revenue annually.
● Retention Costs: The CSM who oversees retention earns $120,000 annually 
and works 2,000 hours yearly. We allocate 1,200 hours/year to customer- 
related work, excluding administration and participation in team events.
Suppose it takes, on average, 6 hours per year to manage an account    that 
generates $18,000 in ARR. This implies that one CSM can handle a 
maximum of 200 accounts. Consequently, the cost per account is $120,000 
divided by 200, equating to $600 each. Doing the math—200 accounts times 
$18,000—we ﬁnd that a CSM looks after $3.6 million in recurring revenue.
10.4.2

In summary, the ﬁrst-year cost to onboard a customer is $208, and for retention, 
it is $600 annually. According to the Growth Formula depicted in Figure 10.24, 
with 40 accounts added, this results in an onboarding cost of 40 x $208 = $8,333 
in the ﬁrst year. Assuming the $600 retention cost applies from the second year 
onward for each account, the annual retention cost for these accounts would be 
40 accounts x $600 = $24,000. 
10.4.3
The objective of running scenarios is not to identify the average number of 
accounts a representative can manage or to determine a reasonable salary. 
Instead, the goal is to establish a process for deducing the retention cost at 
an account level and then calculate the cost that needs to be allocated to 
the GTM motion. This approach is based on assumptions that can be 
discussed, challenged, and, most importantly measured thus improved.
A REVENUE FACTORY MINDSET
Cost of Expansion
In most organizations, the responsibility for Expansion resides either with the 
sales team or the CSM team. However, there are well-known problems with 
each. The CSM team often lacks the proﬁle to perform sales effectively, while 
utilizing the acquisition sales team is too costly to operate on a large scale over 
a longer period. It will impact growth from acquisition, as experienced sellers 
tend to optimize their time around the easier sale to an existing customer.
The solution lies in creating a dedicated role that combines sales and customer 
success with a specialization in relationship development at an executive level. 
This role is commonly known as an Account Manager, or AM. An AM's OTE 
typically hovers around $180,000 against a $4–5 million quota. In this role, an 
AM handles hundreds of accounts, signiﬁcantly higher than a salesperson. It 
causes the AM to operate at about 1/5th of the cost. If the accounts contribute 
over a million dollars in revenue each, the role evolves into that of a Strategic 
Account Manager (SAM). A SAM can oversee a team of people, managing only a 
handful or even a single account, with an OTE/SAM of over $1 million per year.
429

## Page 430

C H A P T E R   1 0    |   G T M   M O D E L
In this scenario we worked on (see Figure 10.24), in which we have 40 accounts, 
we can now calculate the cost that need to be allocated to AM as follows:
● An AM that makes $180,000 and manages 150 accounts would allocate 
$1,200 in cost to each account.
● However we can use data and AI to learn that only 1 in 4 accounts has the 
expansion potential to warrant the assignment of an AM. Since this GTM 
motion secures 40 accounts per year it means we need to allocate 10 x 
$1,200 or $12,000 per year.
It may feel like we are compensating both the CSM and the AM. This is true, 
that indeed is the case, and that is okay. For example the CSM can represent a 
speciﬁc solution, whereas the AM oversees the entire account. 
Determining Sustainability
Selling perpetual software with an upfront payment yields immediate proﬁt. 
However, with subscription revenue, proﬁtability unfolds over time. While 
assessing scalability is relatively simple, assessing sustainability is more 
complex and requires considering various factors over a longer timeframe. 
It starts with the revenue in the ﬁrst year, which is straightforward: Account   for 
the new ARR, subtract the churned ARR, and add the expanded ARR. The 
associated cost of acquisition, mainly the expenses related to marketing and 
sales, takes a big bite out of the ﬁrst-year revenue, delaying proﬁts. Generating 
revenue in subsequent years becomes essential to amortize the considerable 
acquisition cost. This has led to the emergence of a popular metric for 
determining sustainability: CAC Payback. It refers to the time it takes a 
company to recoup the expenses incurred in acquiring a new customer. 
However, as we will learn, recouping the cost of acquisition is just the 
beginning. A sustainable business must cover various other costs and, of 
course, make a reasonable proﬁt. This underscores the importance of 
customer retention and expansion, as they too carry a cost. Although initially 
small, these costs recur annually, accumulating over time.

This underscores the need to analyze the ﬁnancial impact over the years to 
determine sustainability. It explains why it is recommended to put a time 
horizon on a subscription business. 
It is a widely accepted practice for the CFO to amortize the purchase of a large 
infrastructure project, such as routers, over 5 to 7 years. Now, due to the shift in 
the business model, in which the risk of the purchase shifts to the seller, it is the 
seller who needs to amortize the cost over time. Therefore, we recommend  to 
calculate sustainability against the following time horizons:
● Five years for platforms such as CRM, ERP , ATS platforms, etc.
● Three years for applications that sit on top of platforms.
● Twelve months for (browser) plug-ins sold using a monthly subscription.
Using a standardized time horizon allows for evaluating ﬁnancial performance, 
including benchmarking, which supports informed decision-making.
The following ﬁgure presents the compounding of customer revenue over a 
ﬁve-year period, considering both retention and expansion factors. We begin 
with an ARR of $748,500. The Retention (CR7) metric shows the percentage of 
revenue retained from the previous year; for instance, $748,500 multiplied by 
87% results in $651,195. We then apply the Expansion (CR8) of 112% to this 
amount, leading to an adjusted ARR of $729,339 by the end of year 1. 
 ARR(start) Retention Expansion ARR(end) LTV(nY)

Year 1 $748,500 87% 112% $729,339 $748,500
Year 2 $729,339 89% 108% $701,041 $1,477,839
Year 3 $701,041 87% 104% $634,301 $2,178,880
Year 4 $634,301 84% 104% $554,126 $2,813,181
Year 5 $554,126 $3,367,307
The cumulative amount of revenue over time is referred to as LTV(nY), with (n) being 
the number of years. LTV(nY) is needed to apply the cost of acquisition, retention, and 
expansion, determining the sustainability over (n) years.

The Lifetime Value reﬂects the cumulative worth of a customer over a speciﬁed 
time, denoted by L TV(nY). In the ﬁrst year, L TV(1Y) is equivalent to the starting 
ARR. By the ﬁfth year, the L TV of this cohort of customers has increased to an 
L TV(5Y) of $3,367,307. This offers insight into the long-term value of a 
customer cohort and its vital to assess sustainability.
First, we take the cumulative revenue ① and add the costs of acquisition, 
onboarding, retention, and expansion ② (see Table 10.7). In this example, the 
ﬁrst year’s total cost equals to $354,333 ③. Notice that the acquisition cost in 
year one, with $310,000, accounts for 87% of the total cost. It shows that 
customers who churn in year one consume 47.3% of the revenue (L TV(nY)). 
Over subsequent years ④, these costs will be amortized; however, not as fast as 
one might expect. This is because the costs of retention and expansion are 
accumulating to a substantial amount: $172,295 over 5-years ⑤. This brings the 
total GTM cost over 5 years to 14.3% of the revenue. 
A perpetual software business historically allocated 15% to 25% of their revenue 
to S&M. Although undeﬁned today, we recommend to consider a GTM motion 
sustainable when the GTM costs are 20% or less of the revenue earned over a 
given period (L TV(nY)). Future revenues aren't guaranteed, therefore customer 
churn poses a signiﬁcant risk. In the above example, if a customer churns at the 
end of year two, the GTM cost ratio surges to 26.6%, indicating unsustainability.

The Impact of a Marginal Decline on Sustainability
As discussed throughout this book, a recurring revenue model operates in a 
closed-loop system, where marginal adjustments can have signiﬁcant effects. 
Figure 10.25 showed us how a marginal decline in performance caused the 
cost of acquisition to soar to 62% of ﬁrst-year revenue. The table below shows 
the effects of this over 5 years. Note the costs for onboarding, retention, and 
expansion,  decreases with the decline from 40 to 23 commits. This mitigates 
the impact of the decline in revenue (as a % of revenue).

DURABILITY OF GTM MOTIONS
Simply put, durable growth is the response to a simple yet loaded question: What 
happens when we scale growth but at lower costs.
Scalability is about productivity—like ramping up production lines for 
high-volume growth. Sustainability aims for operational eﬃciency and the 
elimination of waste. Durability, then, is the quality control mechanism. 
Neglecting durability will yield fantastic growth metrics, at a low cost,  in the 
short term, but the lack of quality will damage the lifetime value. 
When we think about the quality of a SaaS product, our minds will quickly 
wonder about a product with a beautiful user interface and a fantastic, simple 
user experience. While these are important for emotional impact, durability 
determines whether the customer will repeatedly derive rational beneﬁts from 
your product. That means that quality in the context of a SaaS product equals 
the ability to deliver the promised impact. The key metric that encapsulates this 
is Gross Retention Rate (GRR), a pivotal measure that signiﬁes more than 
numbers; it reﬂects the health of your GTM motion.
The next table examines the impact on a single deal priced at $18,408. Over 
time, the deal experiences contraction due to churn (CR7) and expansion (CR8). 
The signiﬁcant expansion in year two, at 128%, is attributed to a price increase, 
which concurrently leads to a decline in retention to 95%. This change causes 
the NRR (CR7 multiplied by CR8) to rise from 100% to 121.6%. The dynamics 
between GRR and NRR demonstrate the characteristics of a durable business.
While NRR is very important when assessing durability, it also can distort the 
factual picture. That's why GRR is the right metric to reﬂect durability over NRR. 
Although GRR may appear simple, do not underestimate its potency. A 
consistently high GRR over multiple years signals more than just customer 
satisfaction—it indicates a deep-rooted customer reliance. This single metric 
illuminates your value in the market and to your customer base, serving as the 
litmus test of your business's inherent durability.

Determining Durability
Different GTM motions yield varying GRRs (see Table 10.10). What is considered 
a great GRR in one motion may not translate to another. For instance, a Low 
Touch GTM motion typically target a GRR of 85%. In contrast, Enterprise GTM 
motions targets a much higher GRR between 95% and 98%. There’s a correlation 
between higher ACVs and higher GRRs. The higher GRR targets are often met 
through highly specialized roles within customer success teams. For example, 
you may have a dedicated account manager for larger customers and employ a 
specialized customer marketing campaign tailored to individual users and 
operators within a single account. 
Focus on GRR to determine durability.TABLE 10.9

In the previous section on sustainability, we learned that cutting costs through 
technology, such as chatbots, can make operations more sustainable. But that's 
not the only avenue. Growth from existing customers is another cost-effective 
growth strategy, as it comes at a lower cost than acquisition.

Durable Growth Metrics
Durable growth is characterized by rational (quantiﬁable) impact:
● The system adapts quickly and eﬃciently to customer needs, 
demonstrating the product's evolutionary capability. Metric: GRR (CR7).
● Customers experience impact soon after their commitment, highlighting the 
immediate beneﬁt of your product. Metrics: Time to First Impact (Δt6) and 
higher conversion during onboarding (CR6).
● Customer satisfaction right after interaction is crucial for understanding the 
short-term impact of a product on its users. Metric: CSAT.
● As customers' businesses grow, they increase their investment in the 
product, underscoring its critical role in their achievements. Metric: 
Expansion revenue (CR8).
● Customers become advocates, sharing positive experiences and helping to 
spread the word organically. Metrics: Warm lead conversion (VM4), higher 
win rate (CR4), increased ACV (CR5), shorter sales cycle (Δt4), and NPS. The 
latter measures the likelihood of customers recommending a product and 
signiﬁes solid relationships and a healthy brand reputation.
And by behaviors that reﬂect emotional (qualitative) impact:
● Your product becomes essential to customers' daily workﬂows and 
success, signifying its integral role in their professional lives.
● Customers who develop a strong aﬃnity for your brand are eager to 
publicly and vocally associate with it and demonstrate deep brand 
resonance.
● Customers value your insights and expertise, incorporating them into their 
strategic discussions and decision-making, highlighting the impact of your 
thought leadership.
● Public-facing representatives of your brand are seen as heroes, reﬂecting 
respect and admiration for their leadership and vision.
Durable growth serves as a beacon of enduring relationships with customers.

Durability Is Not A Destination. It Is A Journey.
The maturity phases evolve from Scalable Growth, characterized by rapid growth 
at the expense of high customer acquisition costs, to Sustainable Growth, which 
promotes growth at a lower cost but may affect renewal rates. The journey 
culminates in the phase of Durable Growth, where the emphasis shifts towards 
creating lasting impact, leading to customer satisfaction. This satisfaction fuels 
organic growth and lowers acquisition costs, which is crucial to transforming 
durable growth into a self-sustaining ecosystem.
This poses the question: Why not strive for durable growth from the outset? 
The answer lies in the necessity of progressing through scalability and 
sustainability phases, which are vital in a startup's maturation into a scaleup. 
The stages of evolution of a startup are akin to the stages of human 
development, where each stage is fundamental to growth and cannot be 
bypassed without consequences. Just as a child cannot leap into adulthood 
without experiencing adolescence, a startup cannot jump to durable growth 
without ﬁrst navigating the challenges of scalability and sustainability. 
Adolescence, with its tumultuous blend of growth spurts and hormonal changes, 
is essential; it tests and builds resilience, social skills, and self-identity. 
Similarly, a company must learn to manage customer acquisition and market 
expansion before it can ﬁne-tune its operations for sustainability. This stage 
involves learning from intense market engagement, customer feedback, and 
operational challenges. It's where a business develops its character, reﬁnes its 
value proposition, and learns the complexities of its chosen market. Likewise, 
sustainability is like the late teenage years, where ﬁnancial and operational 
discipline must be learned: the company experiments with various growth 
tactics, often keen on eﬃciency and long-term viability—much like a young adult 
learning to balance ambition with practicality. 
Only after successfully passing through these formative stages can a company 
truly understand and implement durable growth strategies. Skipping a stage 
means missing essential lessons needed to make it robust enough to withstand 
the challenges of scaling in a sustainable and lasting manner.

Determine Your GTM motion
Write down the name of each GTM motion from exercise 10.2, such as High 
Touch.  Then move on to marketing motion, is it through inbound, our a speciﬁc 
outbound technique, or a targeting approach such as ABM. Next name the sales 
motion, such as ﬁeld sales. Finally, outline how your customer success 
management (CSM) is structured: by volume, accounts, or segments.

EXERCISE 10.3A
Combined this should reﬂect your main business. If they are not easy to relate to 
your team, or they have lots of programs in each, that is a sign you and the team 
are making things too complicated. 
Check for common use-cases
Now is a good time to review common use-cases and ensure your business is 
not mistakenly categorized under an incorrect GTM motion.
EXERCISE 10.3B
Description Check for
Use-case 1: 
Multiple GTM motions
One GTM motion for the ﬁrst $10M in ARR, 3 GTM motions up to 
$50M in ARR, second product over $100M in ARR
Use-case 2: 
Everything all at once
Are your GTM motions aligned vertically, or are you using a CS motion 
from low-touch with a sales motion from high-touch
Use-case 3: 
ACV Trendline
Is your ACV trending up or down, and if so is it entering a new GTM 
motion, e.g. is the price from high touch dropping int medium touch.
Use-case 4: 
ACV, NRR and L TV
If you take the total L TV over 5 years and divide by 5 are you stil in the 
right GTM motion? This is the result of high NRR.
Use-case 5: 
Mixing GTM motions 
Are you combining a no touch GTM motion such as PLG with a high 
touch GTM motion such as Enterprise sales?

Calculate Scalability: Increase Inputs vs. Improve Throughputs
Perform the following scenario analysis:
EXERCISE 10.5
 Scenario Analysis ARRCOMMIT
Scenario A Using the numbers from exercise 10.4 what is the ARRCOMMIT? 
Scenario B What is the ARRCOMMIT when you double the amount of inputs? 
Scenario C Improve CR(1-5) slightly, and reasonably. What is the ARRCOMMIT? 
Scenario D Use CR(1-5) of scenario C and reduce the amount of Inputs until 
you achieve the same ARRCOMMIT as in scenario A. 
440
If you can achieve growth by doubling the leads without affecting conversion 
rates—a scenario often seen in vertical markets—then prioritize this strategy 
immediately. However, if an increase in leads results in a decrease in conversion 
rates (throughput), you must promptly focus on improving throughput through 
enhancements in skills, tools, and process

10.7 RECAP
In this chapter we explained the GTM Model. The GTM model structures a 
company’s departmental functions into different GTM motions. 
Each GTM motion aligns the efforts across marketing, sales and customer 
success to help the customer achieve recurring Impact. Think of a GTM motion 
as a manufacturing line in a factory. There are 5 GTM motions:
1. No Touch: Tailored for users who self-sell. PLG is a form of No Touch.
2. Low Touch: Also known as inside sales, often supported by a chatbot.
3. Medium Touch: An inside sales operation optimized for high velocity 
by using an development rep (SDR)  who set up a meeting for an seller (AE).
4. High Touch: Customized for large Enterprises requiring extensive support.
5. Dedicated Touch: An entire team dedicated to a single, major client with 
complex needs. This is also known as strategic account sales.
A business has multiple GTM motions. Each GTM motion consumes resources 
to produce recurring revenue. The total revenue is the sum of the revenue 
generated by each GTM motion. 
The GTM model aligns cross functional efforts from marketing, sales, and customer 
success departments to 5 most GTM motions in use today.

The GTM model operates by correlating a product's price and the annual 
volume of deals to provide insight into what is the most effective GTM motion.
The 5 use-cases to consider: 
Use-case 1. Use multiple GTM motions to grow your business: One 
GTM motion for the ﬁrst $10M in ARR, 3 for the ﬁrst $50M in ARR. To go 
beyond $100M in ARR we recommend you launch a new product (again 
$10M for ﬁrst GTM).
Use-case 2. Structure your GTM motion vertically, avoid that you do 
everything all at once.
Use-case 3. Create a trendline of the price of the product, and keep track 
of it to make sure you are not growing out of the chosen GTM motion 
over time.
Use-case 4. If your NRR is high, make sure you pick the right GTM 
motion based on the average price over a 5-year period.
Use-case 5. Be careful mixing GTM motions such as a no touch with 
high touch. They often have longer sales cycles than you think.
The 10 trends changing the industry
Trend 1. The evolving SEO landscape.
Trend 2. The limitations of inbound marketing for sustainable growth.
Trend 3. The rise of conversational marketing powered by AI.
Trend 4. The growing adoption of PLG in B2B.
Trend 5. The saturation of outbound tactics in non-vertical SaaS.
Trend 6. The vertical specialization of inside sales teams (Vertical SaaS).
Trend 7. The increasing popularity of Product-Led Sales (PLS).
Trend 8. The renewed importance of in-person selling.
Trend 9. The resurgence of regional teams.
Trend 10. The era of hyper-specialization.

There Are Three Maturity Phases of a GTM Motion
● Maturity Phase 1. Scalability is like pushing more products through your 
assembly lines to meet increasing demands.  
○ Increase input such as doubling the amount of leads
○ Improve throughput by improving conversion rates based on
■ Streamlining processes by eliminating unnecessary steps,
■ Automating systems with cutting-edge technology, such as AI,
■ Enhancing skills through training, and in-person coaching.
● Maturity Phase 2. Sustainability is akin to optimizing the assembly lines, 
making sure they run eﬃciently while minimizing waste—think of it as 
running an eco-friendly factory where nothing goes to waste. We measure 
cost as follows (see Figure 10.28):
○ Cost of Acquisition, covers Awareness, Education, and Selection.
○ Cost to Serve, covers Onboarding, Retention, and Expansion.
The cost is amortized against a ﬁxed horizon, similar to that of perpetual 
software, and depreciation of on-premise hardware: 
○ Five years for platforms such as CRM, ERP , and ATS, etc.
○ Three years for applications that sit on top of platforms, think of 
Email automation, forecasting or call recording applications,.
○ Twelve months for (browser) plug-ins sold using a monthly 
subscription, often using a no touch GTM motion.

Sustainability is calculated as follows:
1. Calculate the cumulative revenue over a period of time.
2. Calculate the cost for each cost centers. 
3. Sum up the total cost per year.
4. Accumulate the cost over the years
5. Calculate the cost of revenue
If the cumulative cost over the set horizon is <20% it is determined 
sustainable. Note that in a subscription business the cost of expansion 
is about ½ of the cost of acquisition (6) which is in stark contracts to 
perpetual software where it is about ¼.  
● Maturity Phase 3. Durability, then, is your factory quality control department, 
ensuring that every product coming off the line meets high standards.

Different channels can be applied to any GTM motion, with an impact to the journey. 
So, skip sustainability, and you've got a factory spewing out products rapidly, but 
at a signiﬁcant environmental (spam) and ﬁnancial cost—essentially, a factory 
running in overdrive with no thought for the future, e.g. growth at all costs.  But 
similarly, neglect durability, and while your assembly lines may be eﬃcient and 
sustainable, you risk sending out defective or subpar products, which in the case 
of a subscription business means customers do not achieve impact. The lower 
cost might look great on a quarterly report, but customers will eventually turn to 
competitors for better quality, eroding your market share in the long run (and 
with a negative impact on L TV). The key to long-term success lies in building a 
scalable model ﬁrst, and then progressively honing it for sustainability using a 
data-driven, analytical approach using the Growth Formula. Finally, it's crucial to 
allocate resources judiciously across all customer interactions, with a particular 
emphasis on retention strategies that bolster GRR. 
Channels signiﬁcantly inﬂuence scalability and sustainability, and can be 
categorized into 4 types:
● Aﬃliates drive sales or leads using their networks or inﬂuence.
● Strategic Partners elevate your product's value through complementary 
services or technologies, creating a more compelling customer offering.
● Resellers market solutions broadly, with costs ranging from 10% for 
referrals to over 50% for full-service VARs, they often lack deep expertise.
● System Integrators specialize in unifying systems from diverse solutions, 
crucial for targeting speciﬁc industry needs or compliance standards.

You've done it—you've navigated through 6 models and mastered 3 
fundamental scientiﬁc concepts. Grasping this material is no easy task. This 
isn't some light reading to skim over coffee; it's a robust workbook. Whether it's 
your go-to guide in a Revenue Architecture class, a self-study companion, or a 
playbook for your executive team, your copy should be worn, full of scribbles, 
earmarks, and highlights.
Let's recap how you got here. The past 3 chapters have equipped you with 
models crucial for building a subscription business from the ground up. We 
kicked off with the Operating Model, your blueprint for scaling from $20M to $1B 
in revenue. It underscores the necessity of standardized Data Model (the 
Bowtie) , a uniﬁed language (Impact), and a uniform methodology across the 
entire customer journey. Next, the Growth Model guided us along an S-curve, 
punctuated by 12 pivotal revenue breakpoints. Knowing where you are on this 
curve readies you for what's next. Lastly, the GTM Model offered a tactical 
framework for running your revenue factory with a variety of GTM motions, 
aligning marketing, sales, and customer success for meaningful impact.
Along the way, we've unraveled the recurring revenue engine essential to every 
SaaS business. Our journey unveiled a Growth Formula, rooted in unit 
economics, and we created 3 maturity stages: scalability, sustainability, and 
durability—all solidly anchored in scientiﬁc principles.
So, what's next? You're armed with invaluable insights and likely buzzing 
with the energy to put them into action. You've learned the science in Part I, 
designed your revenue strategy in Part II, and constructed your revenue 
system in Part III. Now, take that ﬁnal, crucial step: Simply Deploy.

Does recurring revenue need to be this complex? Shouldn't a great product 
simply sell itself? Unfortunately, in reality, products don't sell themselves–not 
even with a PLG strategy. In fact, making something simple is really hard!
Every day, billions of people glance at their watches to check the time. This act is 
so simple, so mundane, that it's easy to overlook the intricate craftsmanship 
behind it. In classic timepieces, behind the unassuming façade of the hour, 
minute, and second hands, lie complex wheels, springs, and gears operating in a 
delicate balance. The simplicity of telling time is not accidental, not at all, it is a 
deliberate choice by the watchmaker to conceal layers of underlying complexity.
Complexity
Simplicity
Simplicity by design—a carefully engineered piece of machinery that makes it easy 
for the user to tell time.

Likewise, in a subscription business, the simplicity experienced by the customer 
and the GTM team members is a carefully constructed illusion. Beneath this 
surface lies a meticulously engineered ‘revenue propulsion engine.’ This engine 
must be well-calibrated and ﬁne-tuned to manage the intricate operations 
involving hundreds of team members—from product development to customer 
success. Making it look simple is not easy; it is hard, very hard.
Up to this point in the book, we've delved into the nuts and bolts of how this 
metaphorical "watch" is assembled. Next, our objective is to provide you with a 
simple ‘façade’ to make it easy for everyone in your organization to ‘tell time.’

This chapter provides a blueprint for building a revenue factory for companies 
with an ARR ranging from $10M to $10B.
● Think Big – Industrial Scale Impact (11.1): Imagine executing your GTM 
strategy with the precision and eﬃciency of a factory. For this we are going 
to use 3 models: The Growth Model assists in pinpointing your current 
status while identifying potential roadblocks from the past, present, and 
future. The GTM Model organizes your GTM efforts into revenue production 
lines, and the Data Model aids in optimizing the performance of each 
production line and enabling scenario analysis.
● Act Small – Moments Matter (11.2): Instead of boiling the ocean, we will 
keep it simple by creating a customer journey based on a few Moments That 
Matter (MTMs) most to the customer. Then, we are going to consider how 
the GTM team can enhance the experience in those speciﬁc moments. 
Remember, sustainability and durability arise from the compounded impact 
of small actions performed correctly, time and time again.
● Move Fast – Better Yet, Sprint (11.3): Executing short sprints can help you 
achieve quick, within-the-quarter results. If it works, roll it out to the rest of 
the company. Analyzing your Data Model and monitoring leading indicators 
of success can help you pick what you wish to improve. Find out what works 
and do more of it. Stop doing what does not work.
Think Big, Act Small, and Move Fast forms a powerful strategy for achieving the 
ambitious goals of hypergrowth while remaining agile and responsive.

THINK BIG – INDUSTRIAL SCALE IMPACT
When we think of a "Factory," we often imagine something large and expansive, 
conjuring images of vast ﬂoors ﬁlled with machinery, production lines, and 
workers dedicated to various stages of the manufacturing process. This vision 
also applies to a revenue factory that generates millions of dollars in revenue. So, 
let's start by THINKING BIG. We'll approach this in 4 steps:
1. Bring the team together (11.1.1)
2. Identify the growth plan (11.1.2)
3. Structure the business in GTM motions (11.1.3)
4. Establish the growth formulas for each GTM motion (11.1.4)
Let’s break ground on the factory with the ﬁrst step.
Bring the Team Together
We need alignment across every tier of the organization, along the entire 
customer journey. This includes everyone from the executive team to front-line 
managers, down to each individual interacting with customers. What unites all 
these people is a shared commitment to making a positive impact on your 
customers business. If this commitment and dedication wavers, you're veering 
off track. After all, recurring impact leads to recurring revenue. 
We categorize the GTM team organizational structure into 3 layers:
● Executives: The visionaries and strategists
● Managers: The enforcers and optimizers
● Individual Performers: The doers and deliverers
We begin by assembling the executives—a crucial group chosen for their vital 
roles in our mission. The CEO should lead the team and is vital for providing 
directional leadership. Next, add the functional heads responsible for marketing, 
sales, and customer success. Also essential are the Head of Product and the 
CFO, aided by the head of FP&A.

These individuals ensure that the product roadmap and ﬁnancial models align 
with the company vision. It's advisable to limit the team size to 10 members to 
maintain agility. Start with a brieﬁng followed by a kickoff. The goal is for the 
team to walk out of the kickoff meeting believing that customer impact is at the 
center of the customer journey—and that restructuring the organization into a 
revenue factory will provide revenue growth for decades.
Brief the Executive Team
Before the kickoff, organize a 30-minute brieﬁng to set the stage and present the 
day's goal. Include Chapter 1 (PDF) in the invitation with the ask to read it before 
the brieﬁng. During the meeting, explain the goal of becoming a revenue factory 
and the need to structure the organization using GTM motions. It can be helpful 
to ask the head of product to explain the signiﬁcance of the shift from Waterfall 
to Agile development in product development. This is a good time to distribute a 
copy of the book to every team member.
Assign Stewards to Each Chapter
Conclude the meeting by assigning chapters to different participants and 
requesting that they serve as the stewards for their respective chapters during 
the upcoming kickoff. Engaging your team like this will signiﬁcantly increase 
their commitment to the program's success rate.
Enhance engagement during the kickoff by assigning stewards to each chapter. TABLE 11.1

As a steward you serve as your team's primary point of contact for everything 
related to a speciﬁc model. Your responsibility is to gain a deep understanding of 
the model, with a focus on its diagrams and tables. While you're not expected to 
be an outright expert, a comprehensive grasp of the model and the ability to 
quickly locate crucial information are vital. 
Before the kickoff session, as a steward, you should have studied the model, 
including the use of AI to answer any questions you may have had. Additionally, 
it's important to understand where your model ﬁts within the hierarchy of 
models—speciﬁcally, which models are directly above and below—and how your 
model connects to the scientiﬁc principles in Part I.
Organize a Kickoff Meeting
We recommend organizing a kickoff meeting where the steward assigned to each 
speciﬁc model explains how the model works and steps the team through an 
exercise to gain a better understanding of how each model works. A simpliﬁed 
overview of the sequence of the models is outlined below (see Figure 11.1).
GROWTH MODEL
Growth follows an 
s-curve and it has a 
series of breakpoints.
GTM MODEL
Growth comes 
from multiple 
GTM motions.
DATA MODEL
Each GTM motion 
has a growth formula 
with speciﬁc metrics.
OPERATING MODEL
Each metric maps to a 
key moment, that can 
be improved. 
Sequencing of the models in the order that can cause hypergrowth.FIGURE 11.1
● The Growth Model: This model outlines the revenue growth plan for the next 
18 to 24 months. The plans needs to adjust to changes in the marketplace, 
including technological advancements (e.g., AI), valuation shifts (e.g., 
funding), and team performance changes (e.g., productivity and cost). 
● The GTM Model: Structures the business into known GTM motions that align 
with the customer journey to identify areas to invest to achieve the growth 
plan outlined in the Growth Model.
ACTION 11.3

C H A P T E R   1 1   |  S I M P L Y   D E P L O Y 457
● The Data Model: Transitions the GTM team from a funnel to a Bowtie. This 
maps back to the GTM model and enables the team to formulate growth 
strategies for each GTM motion, encompassing the entire customer 
journey, and evaluate their scalability (growth) and sustainability (cost 
eﬃciency). It allows scenario analysis, which will help anticipate the GTM 
system’s response to incremental improvements in speciﬁc actions. 
And lastly:
● The Operating Model: Sellers often guide their buyers through hundreds of 
actions along the customer journey over the customer's lifetime. Yet only 
about a dozen actions deeply impact the customer. Quick response times 
during unexpected system downtimes serve as a prime example. The 
performance of a company in these critical instances can dramatically shift 
the customer's perception and loyalty. They are known as “Moments that 
Matter,” or MTM. Simply put, we are setting out to meticulously blueprint a 
speciﬁc MTM to deliver the optimal experience for customers. By monitoring 
and incrementally reﬁning performance in these moments, we aim to 
achieve marginal gains. A series of minor simultaneous improvements in a 
select number of moments will set off a chain reaction, propelling the 
company into hypergrowth.
A simple example of a blueprint can be seen below (see Figure 11.2)

The 12 revenue breakpoints on the way to becoming a revenue factory.
Identify the Growth Plan
Lead by the steward for the Growth M odel, establish where you are on the 
growth curve (see Figure 11.3) based on the total ARR for the company:
● Current Revenue (ARR): $ ________  on ____________
● Target Revenue (ARR): $ ________  by ____________ (18 to 24 months later)
Identify the revenue breakpoints applicable to your growth trajectory.
This tells you which revenue breakpoints you should have achieved, which one 
you are experiencing, and which ones you should prepare for:
● Breakpoints achieved: __________________________
● Breakpoints missed: __________________________
● Breakpoints in progress:    __________________________
● Breakpoints in the next months:   ___________________
Missed breakpoints must be revisited, as they inevitably hinder progress. It's 
also crucial to note that future breakpoints might entail a phase shift, requiring 
up to 18 months of preparation.

Break Down the Revenue Growth into its Growth Components
In most businesses, revenue growth primarily comes from marketing generating 
leads, sales converting those leads into wins, and customer success maximizing 
revenue from those wins. This strategy often propels companies forward initially. 
However, growth from acquisition will inevitably start to slow. When this happens, 
it's critical to have another source of growth ready to sustain the 
momentum—namely, retention and expansion.
The steward of Chapter 2 should collaborate with the FP&A or RevOps team to 
break down the overall Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) into three growth 
components: Acquisition, Retention, and Expansion. 
This analysis leads to the identiﬁcation of four stages of growth (as outlined in 
Figure 11.4), which tells us what to do and when to do it. For example, Stage 4 is 
all about increasing the lifetime value of customers, which may tell us we need to 
launch a new product.
ACTION 11.5

contributor to revenue, and how growth over time shifts from acquisition to expansion.

Model the Growth Patterns for Each Growth Component
Supported by the steward of the mathematical model, apply a trendline to 
determine the growth pattern behind each of the three growth components. A 
second-degree polynomial might be the most ﬁtting choice for the trendline, but 
feel free to experiment and discuss your ﬁndings as a team. 
Which components are key contributors to growth? Did it start with acquisition? 
At what point did retention become more signiﬁcant? How does expansion 
compare to acquisition in terms of impact? Is the growth driven by acquisition 
speeding up or slowing down? 
ACTION 11.6
Result: It should become clear to all team members that growth consists of three 
components: acquisition, retention, and expansion. Each plays a vital role in 
driving recurring revenue growth at different stages of the journey, with 
retention-based growth closely mirroring the overall growth curve. 
We've also discovered that each growth component follows its unique growth 
pattern, leading to distinct stages where the focus shifts from acquisition to 
retention, then to expansion, and ultimately to enhancing the lifetime value of a 
customer. Armed with this knowledge, we will next explore how these elements 
power the recurring revenue engine.
Contribution of each component to overall growth, its growth pattern, and the type of 
trendline used to determine the growth pattern.

Structure the Business in GTM Motions
To develop a robust growth strategy, we will segment the overall revenue into 
distinct GTM motions, each serving as an independent revenue engine. This 
approach allows us to identify growth areas and concentrate our efforts 
where they will have the most signiﬁcant impact.
Establish GTM Motions
This action begins with the steward assigned to the GTM model presenting an 
overview of how the GTM model works, which is crucial for grounding the 
team in the concepts of the GTM approach (see Figure 11.3.). The team then 
evaluates its current GTM motions within the framework, considering ACV 
and the number of customers served annually. During this phase, it's normal 
for team members to engage in heated debates, pacing around the 
whiteboard and fervently marking it up. 
Unlike traditional GTM approaches, which are primarily focused on customer 
acquisition, our GTM motions span the entire customer lifecycle. This 
comprehensive strategy guarantees a seamless customer experience from 
their ﬁrst website visit to retention and expansion.

Each GTM motion contributing to revenue follows the trajectory outlined in the 
growth model. This journey includes navigating the same 12 revenue 
breakpoints. As the company launches additional GTM motions, it gains 
proﬁciency in managing these breakpoints, accelerating the journey through 
them. Continuous improvement in this domain indicates a maturing business 
capable of scaling growth eﬃciently, a cornerstone of sustainable growth.
Establish the growth formulas for each GTM motion 
Having dissected the revenue factory into several GTM motions, our next step is 
determining each motion's production capacity, known as scalability. We will use a 
Growth Formula for this, but ﬁrst we must establish the data model or Bowtie.
Build the Data Model
The steward of the Data Model draws the Bowtie model on the whiteboard, 
highlighting how the customer journey extends beyond the classic marketing 
and sales funnel.  It shows that recurring revenue begins where the classic 
funnel ends (refer to Section 4.1). As a team brieﬂy discuss the additional stages 
of the Data Model, focusing on the customer's progression through each stage 
without delving into conversion rates or speciﬁc metric names at this time.

Compare the effects of Increasing Inputs vs. Improving Throughput
Next, we determine scalability by performing scenario analysis on this growth 
formula. Scalability can be determined in its response to 2 different scenarios:
● Quantitative response: Increase Input
● Qualitative response: Improve Throughput
As a group, discuss what is more likely, within the company's ability, and quicker 
to establish. You will ﬁnd that mature GTM motions will have a harder time 
increasing Inputs to scale the revenue, meaning it is more worthwhile to invest in 
Throughput performance. In contrast, GTM motions earlier in their maturity cycle 
may see a quicker response by continuing to increase inputs. For GTM motions 
dependent on throughput performance, consider 3 avenues:
● Process Optimization: Many organizations have existing processes that may 
be ineﬃcient, improperly executed, or a combination of both. It's crucial to 
verify the effectiveness of processes and ensure they're properly executed. 
Subsequently, any redundant steps should be removed to enhance eﬃciency.
● Use of Technology: Technology can automate proven processes, enabling 
faster growth at lower costs and, when done correctly, at a higher quality.
● Skills Development: In processes dependent on people, increasing 
scalability involves enhancing workforce productivity. Productivity 
improvements can be achieved through targeted training and coaching.
Determine Scalability and Sustainability
Discuss as a team what improvements can improve the scalability of a GTM 
motion. Utilizing the Growth Formula for scenario analysis is crucial (see 
Figures 11.7 and 11.8). Determine the impact of a few small enhancements. 
Next, incorporate variables such as campaign costs, personnel, and technology, 
to determine sustainability (see Figure 10.7). Prioritizing improvements that 
boost recurring customer impact (quality) will not only accelerate revenue 
growth organically but also enhance scalability (enabling faster growth) and 
sustainability (achieving more eﬃciency).

ACT SMALL. MOMENTS MATTER.
We now have a revenue factory with multiple GTM motions that produce 
revenue like production lines. The revenue growth is based on the growth 
formula. Next, we will cause the revenue factory to respond to our actions by 
making marginal incremental improvements at strategic points along the 
customer journey. The next 3 topics describe this: 
1. Establish a Customer Journey for each GTM motion (11.2.1)
2. Identify the Moments that Matter (11.2.2)
3. Make Incremental Improvements for each MTM (11.2.3)
As Lao Tzu said, “A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.” But 
that step must be in the right direction—for us, that means starting by meeting 
the customers where they are.
Establish a Customer Journey for each GTM Motion
Each GTM motion has its own customer journey. The journey unfolds through a 
tapestry of interactions—emails, meetings, calendar invites, and social 
engagements—creating a unique experience for each customer. Even for the 
best organizations, it is unreasonable to expect a 5-star experience for each 
interaction. But is it even necessary?
Amidst this ocean of interactions, all journeys share a handful of crucial 
moments. These moments serve as crossroads and wield signiﬁcant inﬂuence 
over the entire customer experience. We refer to these moments as Moments 
that Matter, or MTM. The impact of how the seller treats these MTMs cannot be 
overstated; excelling in these MTMs can transform the customer journey from 
ordinary to extraordinary. Dan and Chip Heath explored this concept in their 
book, The Power of Moments, referring to them as "Experiences That Have An 
Extraordinary Impact." Identifying and mastering these MTMs is the key to 
enhancing the customer journey. By focusing on a few crucial moments, we can 
elevate the entire customer experience.

 PROMISE OF IMPACT.
Next, we are going to create a simple customer journey for a speciﬁc GTM 
motion. The stewards in charge of the Operating Model can help direct the team 
to build this journey, but important, starting from the right side of the 
Bowtie—where customers consistently see recurring Impact—instead of the left 
side, where they are merely considered leads (see Figure 11.9).
Build and Impact Journey
Starting on the right, pinpoint the top 5 recurring impacts that your most 
successful customers have in common. Consider consulting your CAB for 
insights before the session. As you move towards the left side, remember that 
the impact that customers' value can differ across stages. For example, a quick 
response time might be crucial during the awareness stage, while a customized 
demonstration may be more appreciated during the education stage. While 
these impacts are vital early on, they may diminish as the relationship matures.
Consider the terminology used for stages and metrics within your customer 
journey. Opt for customer-centric or impact-focused terms. Words matter. For 
instance, rather than “Closed/Won,” consider “Mutual Commitment” or simply 
“Commit.” This term more accurately represents the moment when both parties 
agree to a partnership for the coming years.

Identify Moments That Matter
Rather than leaving these important moments to chance, we can intentionally 
create and orchestrate them. We can blueprint each of these moments, utilizing 
either technology (AI) or staff skill training to create memorable experiences. 
Identify Moments that Matter (MTM)
Here are some moments that we've consistently observed across customers:
● First visit to the website.
● Quality of a webinar.
● Keynote presentation.
● Content such as a post.
● Easy-to-download app.
● Quick response time.
● Discovery call.
● Fantastic emo.
● Stakeholder meeting.
● Onboarding experience.
Improving each of these moments iteratively can drive growth, but when 
combined, they start to amplify each other. For example:
● First diagnose on the desired Impact, then demonstrate the Impact.
● Decision criteria based on the Impact, onboard to ﬁrst Impact.
● Provide insights into the recurring Impact, renew the contract.
● Identify new areas of Impact, expand the business.
By leveraging the elements that contribute to these memorable experiences, 
organizations can profoundly inﬂuence recurring Impact, thus resulting in 
recurring revenue. This insight empowers organizations to uncover the moments 
that matter most to their customers and blueprint the absolute best experience, 
leading to more meaningful and impactful outcomes, and create a competitive 
advantage that is diﬃcult to replicate. New moments that are uncovered lead to 
a new opportunity to blueprint and improve. Pick 7 to 10 Moments that Matter. 
Make sure they cover the entire customer journey and go beyond customer 
acquisition.

● Fantastic product experience.
● Amazing visuals (UX).
● Easy to navigate (UI).

Incremental Improvements
One of the early "aha" moments we identiﬁed from the mathematical model is that 
hypergrowth is fueled by the compound impact of a few actions that repeat 
themselves. We demonstrated that the acquisition engine operates on repetition, 
such as the frequency of the number of meetings, which differs from how 
retention and expansion function. Retention and expansion repeat over time and 
build upon themselves, much like a snowball rolling downhill. Throughout the 
chapters, we've also demonstrated repeatedly that a marginal improvement of 
10% across 7 throughput conversion points will double the output.
Aim to improve the conversion rate of each MTM by 10%.
Based on the moments you've identiﬁed in the previous section, link them to a 
conversion metric. Record the current conversion metric associated with that 
action and target a 10% improvement.

Now that we understand how it works, how do we achieve this? For that, we'll 
introduce the concept of “Sprints,” which is explained in the following section.

MOVE FAST . BETTER YET , SPRINT!
We're borrowing the idea of a "sprint" from Agile software development. Sprints 
break down large, complex projects into manageable tasks. Each speciﬁc task is 
based on a repeatable process, executed over 2 to 4 weeks. This ensures 
immediate impact and allows for rapid iteration and continuous improvement. 
Sprints enhance team collaboration, making them an indispensable tool for 
achieving success on large, complex projects.
Our twist on sprints will leverage the breakdown of the entire customer journey 
into a few moments that matter ①. Focusing on the gradual improvement of 
these moments leads to a compound impact. This is achieved by conducting a 
masterclass focused on a distinct skill ②. Each team member is tasked to apply 
this skill in the ﬁeld right away ③. The team cultivates ongoing enhancement 
through collaboration and rapid iteration of best practices. By combining related 
skills, such as Discovery of Impact with Demonstration of Impact, we can cause 
ampliﬁcation ④.

Analyze the team's performance metrics to identify what should be improved to 
drive the right impact. For instance, is NRR too low? Then the skill to focus on is 
customer retention. Are contract values too low due to excessive discounting? 
Then focus on making more effective trades during the negotiation stage. Pick 
just one metric that will signiﬁcantly impact the business if it can be improved.
Example: Improving the Onboarding Experience
Let’s consider the Onboarding of a customer to be a moment that matters. The 
customer just spend money and wants to feel this is warranted. The ﬁrst step is 
to divide up the task into micro-skills to be done correctly and in the right order. 
In this case when listening to a few onboarding calls, we ﬁnd the following 
micro-skills can lead to a improvement with signiﬁcant downstream impact:
● A consistent hand-off between sales and onboarding using a standardized 
method such as SPICED.
● To get the right people from the customer team to show up for the kickoff by 
using triggers identiﬁed by the sales team.
● Make the kickoff not about checking boxes, but use it to identify the Impact 
the customer is expecting and in what timeframe. 
● Re-diagnose the customer's Critical Event, which may have changed or split 
over multiple events, and create a mutually agreed Critical Event timeline.

 Engagement
After the handoff, 
write down what the 
recurring Impact is 
and when it will be 
available.

Example: Improving the Expansion Rate
We have conclusive evidence that expansion is more likely when you connect 
with more people across levels and responsibilities. Therefore:
● Go from a single-threaded account to multiple stakeholders per account, 
leveraging your executives and creating a 3x3 or a 5x5 matrix.
● Diagnose the customer (Emotional) Impact across multiple stakeholders 
using contextual diagnostic questions.
● Present products provocatively, e.g., relate it to the Impact the customer 
wants to achieve, combined with your industry knowledge.
● Run a professional stakeholder meeting by sharing customer stories of 
companies in a similar situation that beneﬁted from working with you. 
This shows how to turn a moment that matters into a few micro-skills. 
Conduct a Masterclass
Once the skill gap is discovered, train your employees on this singular skill. The 
following are the keys to success: 
● Keep a maniacal focus on one single skill. Don't be tempted to address 
any other adjacent or "quick" challenges. 
● Start simple like improving discount. Don't start with the most complex 
skill like Enterprise stakeholder management you have been frustrated 
about for years. It can take months or even years to master such a skill. 
● Keep it clear. This training session should be at most one to two hours. 
Learners should leave the session knowing what "great" looks like. 
● Create an immersive educational experience. A masterclass must be led 
by an expert in the ﬁeld, who offers participants an in-depth exploration of 
a topic, skill, or area of expertise, designed to provide practical insights 
and hands-on learning experience.
Masterclasses are a highly effective and appealing learning format. However, 
they are not good enough on their own; they still need one more step: coaching!

Coach the team using real-life use cases
This is where a skill starts to stick. Coaching is very different than managing. 
Although both involve guiding and developing individuals, coaching focuses 
more on empowering individuals to achieve their potential, while managing 
focuses more on directing and overseeing work to achieve organizational goals. 
The keys to successful coaching: 
● Repetition and reinforcement. This must be done weekly over 4 weeks.
● Look for Incremental Improvement. Do not expect large bumps in 
improvement; instead, look for small steps. Over time, it will accumulate.
● Frontline managers must be front and center in these coaching sessions. 
Their commitment and presence show the rest of the team how vital these 
coaching sessions are.
● Coach against actual customer call recordings. Break down what happens 
in an actual call, showing examples of what it looks like when it goes right 
and wrong; both are crucial learning moments. 
● Track Leading Indicators: Identify simple-to-extract leading indicators, 
such as how many times customer stories are shared. This can help you 
course-correct where needed. Here is the exciting part: you should see 
measurable, albeit marginal, Impact within weeks.
● Sprint as a Team: Learning science tells us that people learn from training 
(10%), from each other (20%), and from in-the-ﬁeld application (70%). 
However, the latter is ampliﬁed based on the network effect, which is based 
on learning from each other. 
Rolling out sprints requires your managers to become coaches, which means 
they must believe in what you’re trying to accomplish with the new GTM 
framework—or "The {Your Company Name} Way." Managers playing a more 
active role in improving performance through coaching is a big trend in the 
industry today. As coaches, they must be able to inspect the activities of their 
team members and inspire them to do 10% better.

Combine Sprints to Amplify the Effect
Integrating and applying individual skills in a coordinated manner ampliﬁes 
their collective impact beyond the sum of the individual sprints. For instance, 
sequencing sprints—one focusing on diagnosing Impact, followed by another 
on demonstrating Impact—creates a powerful effect. To stay competitive, it's 
crucial to continuously revisit and reﬁne your strategy, using tools like the 
Bowtie model to plan future sprints. The objective is not just to match but to 
exceed the achievements of the preceding sprints. This ongoing process of 
iteration keeps the sprints fresh and aligned in a changing market.
Sprints are simple concepts based on coaching, and every parent who 
coached a soccer or baseball team knows how this works. Just as coaching 
elevates individual performance, AI can revolutionize system eﬃciency and 
effectiveness. With the correct application, AI enables scaling of successful 
strategies, ensuring faster and more eﬃcient outcomes.
Launch a GTM Council 
As the year 2000 approached, the technical challenges were signiﬁcant and 
costly, necessitating updates to software, hardware replacements, and the 
development of contingency plans. To tackle these issues, companies 
established special councils and task forces dedicated to the assessment, and 
remediation of their systems. Despite widespread concerns, the transition into 
the new millennium was remarkably smooth. The response to Y2K stands as a 
prominent example of how coordinated efforts can effectively address complex 
challenges. 
This shows the power of a counsel and we recommend establishing a GTM 
Council. Meeting monthly, this governance body will assess the outcomes of 
recent sprints and chart the course for future ones. To facilitate this, the council 
should integrate the Bowtie model into a permanent dashboard accessible to all 
GTM teams. This dashboard simpliﬁes holding regular discussions and serves 
as the heartbeat of your organization, assuring real-time monitoring and 
departmental alignment. The gains from the revenue factory inspire you to think 
big. However, to be successful, you must start small, and to capture growth, you 
have to move fast.

Time to Get Everyone Involved 
The key to successful implementation comes down to a simple statement: 
involvement creates commitment, so it's time to get others involved. This can be 
a subset of second- and third-level managers, but don't exclude forward-leaning 
and inﬂuential frontline managers and individual contributors. 
Involve Everyone
Re-run a similar experience with these broader groups and eventually every part 
of the company. You can shorten it by using highly relevant examples for each 
group. For example, CS can focus on seven moments in retention, and sales can 
focus on seven moments in the sales process. 
While the second- and third-level managers catch up, the executive team needs 
to gain accurate and real-time trendlines for each metric of the Growth Model for 
different GTM motions (see Section 6.3.2, in particular Figure 6.8). 
You now have 3 action items to tackle in the next month:
● Propagate the Models (in particular the Bowtie), Impact, and Marginal Gains 
Theory to the next level of managers.
● Have people across the team specialize in a model so that when you 
get together as a team, they can say, "Hang on a minute. According to 
my model, this is going to cause issues..." Remember from Chapter 3, 
the taller we make the towers of a suspension bridge, the thicker the 
main cables need to be.
● Have a team pull more detailed trend lines of speciﬁc volume and conversion 
metrics together and present this to the executive team in a following up 
meeting called “GTM Diagnostics.” This meeting lasts 60 to 90 minutes and 
will create a dashboard moving forward.  
Summary: At the end of the day, you should have an idea of which metrics to 
improve for each GTM motion, which actions you’re going to rally around to 
impact those metrics, and what your team needs to do to make that happen.

RECAP
A startup's growth trajectory typically follows an S-curve. This curve results from 
the contribution of several GTM motions, each following an S-curve. Within each 
GTM motion, startups must navigate through twelve revenue breakpoints. These 
breakpoints revolve around establishing repeatable processes aligned with the 
customer's journey. Each process consists of a series of actions. Certain actions 
stand out as they create moments that matter to a customer. Think of a quick 
response time, for example. 
Monitoring the performance of the actions against these moments, over time, 
pinpoints opportunities for incremental improvements. Executing these actions 
can lead to marginal gains. When applied to 5 to 10 actions along the customer 
journey, this strategy can drive hypergrowth.
11.5
GROWTH MODEL
Growth follows an 
S-curve and it has a 
series of breakpoints.
GTM MODEL
Growth comes 
from multiple 
GTM motions.
DATA MODEL
Each GTM motion 
has a growth formula 
with speciﬁc metrics.
OPERATING MODEL
Each metric maps to a 
key moment that can 
be improved. 
The process for each GTM motion is captured by what we call a growth formula. 
This mathematical equation demonstrates that slight, incremental 
improvements across a series of actions can lead to disproportionate gains, 
such as hypergrowth. 
Therefore, the secret to growth lies in making incremental enhancements—by as 
little as 10%—to the actions that are most impactful to customers. When these 
improvements are applied concurrently across various GTM motions, the 
cumulative effect leads to sustainable and hyper growth.
The revenue factory operates along a series of models that reﬂect its behavior. FIGURE 11.12

Deliberate design and structuring of systems and processes, based on scalability 
and repeatability, lead to the creation of fractal systems. Both cloud infrastructure 
and software function as such fractal systems. However, most GTM strategies, 
with the exception of PLG, do not operate as fractal systems. This discrepancy 
results in anomalies in growth and cost patterns, largely attributable to the 
inﬂuence of irrational human behavior, most notably “grow at all cost.”
By adhering to the principles of the revenue factory, the GTM organization is 
structured to function within proven systems and processes. This approach 
fosters more fractal-like patterns within a GTM organization, enabling companies 
to follow a more reliable growth trajectory. The guiding principles are clear:
● Think Big: Build a revenue factory capable of scaling growth in a cost- eﬃcient 
manner, by delivering a quality product. Within this factory, GTM motions 
function like revenue production lines.
● Act Small: Focus on incremental improvements that, cumulatively, will 
have a signiﬁcant impact.
● Move Fast: Employ Sprints, borrowed from Agile Software Development, 
to achieve these incremental improvements one action at a time, in rapid 
succession.
As you turn the ﬁnal page, understand that the systems and processes are just 
one part of the equation. The key driver is your belief that you, too, can become a 
pioneer, an architect of wonder, crafting businesses that not only meet growth 
needs but also stand the test of time and leave us in awe.

ANNEX B. UNDERSTANDING REVENUE GROWTH
In his 2015 Crunchbase article titled "The SaaS Adventure," Neeraj Agrawal 
described a growth pattern commonly observed in the early years of the Golden 
Era known as T2D3, which stands for “Triple, Triple, Double, Double, Double.”
The following ﬁgure depicts a use case for achieving growth using the 
example of BestCo, a ﬁntech company that grew from $1M to $100M ARR 
over the course of 8 years. Like many companies, BestCo followed the T2D3 
pattern during its initial 5 years: tripling from $1M to $3M to $9M, then nearly 
doubling from $9M to $15M to $27M to $47M. 
Revenue growth of BestCo, a ﬁntech that grew from $1M in 2013 to $115M in 2021.FIGURE B1
Between 2012 and 2022, the SaaS market experienced remarkable growth, 
expanding from 1,000 to 35,000 companies. The high ROI associated with 
SaaS-based Startups led to many more funds being raised, intensifying 
competition among industry leaders. Consequently, founders began 
demanding higher valuations, prompting VCs to seek higher growth rates.

This shift is signiﬁcant. It caused many founders to lose sight of their 
original focus—building an exceptional product that enabled customers 
to achieve tangible Impact. Instead, their sole objective became revenue 
growth—a self-centered goal detached from customer satisfaction. This mindset 
ultimately created the growth-at-all-costs mantra. 
While we cannot overlook the important role that the growth-at-all-costs mantra 
played in the emergence of countless SaaS companies, we must 
also pause to reﬂect: will the strategies that brought us here be sustainable 
now that costs have gone up and effectiveness has dropped?
NEWCO (a SaaS Company Using a Recurring Revenue Model)
NEWCO is a company that operates on a recurring revenue model with 
an ACV of $40,000 per year. In the ﬁrst year, NEWCO's marketing and sales 
efforts generated $2 million in revenue by acquiring 50 customers. 
Revenue growth proﬁle of a SaaS business using a recurring revenue model.FIGURE B2

However, NEWCO doesn't start from zero in year 2. Assuming all 50 customers 
renew their subscriptions, NEWCO begins year 2 with $2 million 
in recurring revenue. With the same marketing and sales team and resources, 
NEWCO can achieve the same results, generating an additional $2 million in 
revenue. This results in 100% revenue growth without further investment in 
marketing and sales.

What makes this scenario even more interesting is the potential for 
exponential growth. Suppose we choose to increase investment in growth, and 
we assume that growth from customer acquisition increases by 100% and 50% 
in subsequent years. In that case, we would witness a signiﬁcant surge in 
revenue (as shown in Figure B3).

A closer look at the data in Table B1 provides a crucial insight: when we 
consistently achieve a 100% renewal rate and continue to grow from 
acquisition—even when the growth rate is halved from 100% to 50%—it still 
results in exponential growth in total revenue, from $2M to $6M to $12M.
In the beginning, exponential growth results from renewals and growth in acquisition. TABLE B1

The Impact of Customer Expansion
Up to this point, we have considered a scenario with a 100% renewal rate— 
or a retention rate of 100%. Achieving a high retention rate is essential in any 
subscription- based business. This relies heavily on the customer success 
function, which is vital throughout the entire customer lifecycle. 
For example, CS teams in a recurring revenue business should proactively 
inform customers when they have achieved their desired impact. This is 
imperative because SaaS products continually evolve, incorporating new 
features to meet the growing demands of customers. Consequently, it is 
common for SaaS companies to implement a price increase of approximately 
5% to 8% per year as part of their expansion strategy. However, if customers 
are not proactively informed when their Impact is achieved, the price increase 
may antagonize them. 
The recurring revenue engine holds even more power. The ongoing relationship 
established via customer success ensures renewals with price increases across 
the board and opens up opportunities for expansion within a subset of 
customers. For example, CS teams can often drive additional sales from existing 
customers by identifying new users and exploring other use cases.
Let's consider an average growth of 20% from expansion across all customers. 
(It’s important to note that achieving a 20% expansion rate is challenging and 
typically only accomplished by the top 10% of SaaS companies; nevertheless, 
this highlights the signiﬁcant impact of this growth function.)

Sales stages are the steps that a lead takes through your company's sales 
pipeline before becoming a customer. These stages are a group of actions. 
Stages can differ from one business to another, depending on product 
complexity and sales methodology. In most cases, there are about 6 
to 8 stages similar to those depicted in the ﬁgure below. 
A simpliﬁed 7-stage sales process as commonly seen in most B2B sales companies.FIGURE C1
In a stage-based process, each stage has entry criteria, several actions per 
stage, and exit criteria to advance to the next stage. Most actions involve a 
call, an email with materials to review, or a meeting (remote or in person). 
The stage-based approach proves beneﬁcial when humans need to interpret a 
deal's status, as it facilitates structure and enables stage-based forecasting.

However, this stage-based approach is typically one-directional. Customers are 
guided through these stages sequentially, primarily for the seller's beneﬁt and to 
enhance forecasting accuracy. Unfortunately, customers rarely follow a linear 
path and often hop back and forth through the process in a somewhat random 
pattern over a period of 12 to 18 months.
A more reﬂective pattern of how customers step through a series of meetings. This 
concept is known in mathematics as graph theory. It allows AI systems to learn which 
sequence of meetings causes the best results. 
FIGURE C2
Visualizing the sales process as a series of key meetings and charting the 
customer's navigation path through these meetings presents a different picture 
(Figure C2). From a scientiﬁc perspective, each path the seller suggests has a 
weight associated with it that impacts the success rate, the length of the sales 
cycle, and the price the customer will pay. If a demo follows a discovery call, for 
example, the chances of winning may increase by 4%. 
AI can help us decide if and when we need to do something. For example, we 
anticipate that data will suggest a consultative approach—and in particular, the 
use of a needs assessment call—to signiﬁcantly impact the chances of securing 
a deal and increasing the price. While this is the current trend, we

can’t deﬁnitively say whether it applies to all customers or if it will continue to be 
the case. AI can help us make informed decisions about if and when this 
approach should be used based on various factors, such as whether the 
customer has already been through a lot of education about the product or pain 
by watching your company’s videos.
The Presence of Micro-Actions
Upon closer inspection, each meeting doesn't just lead into the next meeting as 
depicted by the straight line that connects the two. In reality, each meeting is 
connected through a series of actions such as preparation calls, email 
invitations, follow-ups, and follow-through messages. We refer to these as 
micro-actions. 
Micro-actions make the entire process work. A single micro-action skipped 
or ill-performed can derail the whole project. An incredibly high volume of 
micro-actions are required in a sales cycle. Many managers who have never 
been in the role before are oblivious to the volume and importance of these 
actions, which is why many front-line reps across sales and customer 
success feel misunderstood.
In Figure C3, you'll see 4 micro-actions surrounding the demo itself: an invitation 
is sent, preparation for the demo, an immediate post-demo follow-up (such as a 
thank you note with a link to the recording), and a follow-through message the 
next day with the promised materials.
Some of these micro-actions signiﬁcantly increase the chances of winning. Once 
hundreds to thousands of deals have been processed, an AI system 
can determine the most logical path under various conditions for the highest 
probability of winning. Over time, with advances in real-time AI response, 
this could evolve into a sales guidance system in which the AI makes 
recommendations similar to lane-assist technology while driving a car.
When compared to stage-based sales, the role that AI can play becomes evident 
as it performs tasks beyond today's human capacity and merges roles.

Micro-actions connect calendared meetings—they provide a more accurate picture of 
the number of actions a salesperson must take to gain mutual commitment from both 
sides.
Imagine that, through AI, a single individual could handle outreach, craft the 
appropriate marketing materials, undertake qualiﬁcation, provide comments, 
manage onboarding, and perhaps even deliver the customer success

For AI to be effective, it must have access to thorough and precise data 
spanning the entire customer journey. This data should be normalized, aligning it 
with a standardized Data Model that is adopted company-wide. If there are gaps 
in the data, AI might make assumptions. These assumptions can introduce 
inaccuracies, potentially diminishing the accuracy of predictions and, 
consequently, business eﬃciency. On the other hand, given limitless and 
accurate data, an AI system could, in theory, attain unparalleled eﬃciency and 
effectiveness, barring external variables like economic downturns or changes 
within a customer organization. It would look something like this:
● Conversion Eﬃciency: With an ideal AI model, 100% of leads could convert 
into opportunities, and 100% of those opportunities could further convert into 
customers. The AI system could use various data points to accurately target 
the most promising leads, thereby maximizing conversion rates.
● Customer Retention: The AI system could predict customer behaviors, 
preferences, and potential issues, enabling proactive customer retention 
strategies. Customers would remain for the entire duration of their 
suspected lifetime value (L TV), contributing the maximum amount of 
revenue.
● Seamless Prospect Generation: Existing customers would seamlessly 
transform into new prospects as individuals move between companies. AI 
could track such movements, identify the potential for engagement, and 
initiate contact.
The Bowtie model would essentially evolve into a “Roman collar,” symbolizing 
market dominance. Historically, only a handful of products, such as PowerPoint, 
Intel chips, Adobe products, and TiVo, have come close to this state of near- 
perfect eﬃciency and effectiveness, largely owing to their innovative application 
of data and technology. However, such dominance is often ﬂeeting as lower-cost 
competitors eventually surface.

This highlights the potential of sophisticated AI to propel companies to a 
commanding market position. But to achieve this, ﬁrms must maintain rigorous 
data management practices and possess a profound understanding of 
customer behaviors and market dynamics. While AI can substantially optimize 
GTM processes, it ampliﬁes the signiﬁcance of human insight and decision- 
making, especially in relationship management. Everything begins with GTM 
processes.
To win in the next decade will require the full utilization of AI. Those companies 
that will succeed must harness—no, embrace—AI within every part of their 
business. Therefore, the roadmap is simple:
● Deﬁne and connect departments and the functions within each department. 
This will require a common language, a uniform approach, and a 
standardized Data Model.
● Close the loops. With open-loop systems such as SEO, cold outbound, and 
email campaigns seeing diminishing returns, perhaps it's time to invest in 
closed-loop systems.
● Leverage AI. Once your company operates as a system and the loops are 
closed, you can leverage the advantages of AI and do what the subscription- 
based model was designed to do—deliver compound growth.
A venture-funded business will generate wealth, which will fund new innovation, 
accelerating further advances. In a way, it's already forming its own closed loop.

Historically, salespeople selling to Enterprise customers pride themselves on 
being better than their peers selling to SMBs. Now we’ll test whether they are. 
Let's use the industry-wide benchmark from Table 6.5, which provides an 
average win rate of 30% for an Enterprise deal with an ACV of $120,000 and a 
win rate of 20% for an SMB deal with an ACV of $10,000.
Consider this: an Enterprise sales rep typically needs to schedule a larger 
number of meetings to close a $120,000 deal compared to an SMB sales 
rep closing a $10,000 deal. For instance, it might take the Enterprise rep 
12 scheduled meetings to close an Enterprise deal, whereas the SMB 
rep might only need 5 meetings to close an SMB deal. 
With these data points, we can calculate the difference in conversion rates per 
meeting. We ﬁnd that the win rate is actually the product of the conversion rate 
at each meeting. This gives us the following insights:
Win rate = CR number of meetingsFORMULA E1
ANNEX E. MATHEMATICAL APPROACH TO SALES EFFICIENCY
496
CR =  5 meetings
Now, if we regroup that formula around the conversion rate per meeting, 
we get the following:
CR =  number of meetings
20% win rate
And if we apply the arguments for SMB, we get:
= 72.48% (round it to 72%)

## Page 497

Win rate = 72% × 72% × 72% × 72% × 72% ~ 20%. 
Now let's compare this to the Enterprise performance per meeting:
CR =  12 meetings 30% win rate = 90%
It means that an Enterprise rep, on average, has to convert at a signiﬁcantly 
higher win rate and keep this performance up for a much longer time: 
Win rate = 90% × 90% × 90% × 90% × 90% × 90% × 90% × 90% × 90% × 90% × 
90% × 90%

This graphical representation of the win rate tells us we have 2 different 
functions for SMB and Enterprise. It explains, for example, why organizations 
should be careful when promoting an SMB rep to Enterprise without proper 
training and ﬁeld experience. It also shows that, eventually, all deals are lost as 
long as we have enough meetings. In this particular example, it takes about 14 
meetings to kill an SMB deal (or to get to a win rate < 1%) and 44 meetings for an 
Enterprise deal (not detailed in the graph above).
You will notice the disproportionate impact we explained earlier: the duplication 
of input in the number of meetings (Δx) leads to a signiﬁcantly smaller output in 
win rate (Δy). For instance, when examining the ﬁrst 3 to 5 meetings, a steeper 
decline is observed early on, highlighting their diminishing effect on the win rate. 
The visualization of the win rate underscores the signiﬁcance of these initial 
meetings and reveals that they have a more signiﬁcant impact on SMB deals 
than Enterprise deals.
It is important to consider that there are limitations to any model. These 
limitations are often found in edge cases involving extreme or exceptional 
scenarios that cause results that fail to align with reality. For example, this model 
suggests that your win rate would be 100% if you performed zero meetings. 
That, of course, is not the case. This does not invalidate the model; instead, it 
highlights the need to reﬁne our understanding, particularly when it comes to the 
boundaries of the model. Remember, we are merely at the start of a journey to 
develop scientiﬁc frameworks for acquisition and expansion, and we still have a 
lot of work ahead of us.
Use Case: The Drop in Win Rate of Q1 2023
From November 2022 to April 2023, the SaaS market witnessed a signiﬁcant 
decline in the win rate for Enterprise-sized deals. The average win rate for deals 
with ACVs between $50,000 and $500,000 decreased from 29% to 18%. During 
this period, revenue leaders reported that deals were not being lost, but 
customers were experiencing "indecision.” According to interviews with the team 
at DCM Insights, this indecision was driven by a fear of making the wrong 
decision, which led to an increase in the number of scheduled meetings. As Ted 
McKenna aptly stated, "FOMU is exceeding FOMO." The “fear of messing up” 
became more signiﬁcant than the “fear of missing out.”

In March 2023, during an interview with the Chief Sales Oﬃcer of one of the 
world's largest SaaS companies, she highlighted that closing deals now required 
signiﬁcantly more effort from their sales teams. Speciﬁcally, there was a notable 
increase in the number of meetings, particularly with stakeholders from the 
CFO's oﬃce, to justify the investment amidst the market's economic strain. 
Mathematically, this aligns with our ﬁndings, as the increase in the number of 
meetings correlates with a drop in the win rate. Now, let's further explore if we 
can mathematically substantiate this observation:
Win rate = CR (n) number of meetings
18% = 0.9 (n) number of meetings
For some topical fun, let’s use an AI prompt to help us solve for the number of 
meetings by stating, "If x = y^n and I have x and y, how do I solve for n?" we get:
Number of meetings(n) = ln(0.18) / ln(0.9) = 16 meetings
The mathematics explain what we observed in the ﬁeld. The average win rate 
dropped from 30% to 18%, while at the same time the average number of 
meetings increased from 12 to 16 (see Figure E1).

Underperformance is plaguing SaaS companies everywhere—and the problem is 
more acute than most revenue leaders realize: 2 of every 3 reps are failing to 
meet quota, and 40% of the reps can quickly increase their performance—with 
the right focus.
How Did We Get Here? 
During the Golden Era of the last 10 years, SaaS companies went through a 
period of overhiring. Software from modern SaaS companies was so sought 
after that companies were scrambling to hire as many people as possible to 
meet the market demand. In a strong market, it wasn't too hard for these 
employees to be successful; the product was in demand, so it was easier to 
sell. But the cracks begin to show when the market softened and weakened, 
as it started to do in 2021 and 2022. 
What Are those Cracks, Exactly? 
Most companies are now experiencing the reality that 32% of the GTM team 
can operate at a “normal” level, while 68% cannot. In other words, 2 out of 3 reps 
can no longer hit their targets. What does “normal” mean? In sales, this typically 
means hitting at least 80% of the quota regularly. Those between 50% and 80% 
may have a decent chance of reaching a ”normal” level, depending on the 
situation—perhaps with more guidance from their manager, more training, or 
more time to develop their skills. However, those operating at 50% or below will 
be a risk to the organization; the company is investing resources into those team 
members, but they are falling far short of the expected results.
In addition to understanding how many reps fall into each category, it’s important 
to look at the impact that each cohort delivers to understand the impact of the 
problem. The “normal” performers can deliver 1.53 times more than the 
underperformers. And this phenomenon is happening across the entire GTM 
team: the sales team is falling far short of meeting the team quota for new 
business, marketers are not connecting with enough ICP accounts, 
and the CS team cannot come close to its goal for NRR.

Prior Solution Why it Doesn’t Solve the Current Problem
Large-scale training 
programs
Traditional training programs can take a long time to realize Impact: 
reps can be trained and certiﬁed, but because they are learning 
several skills within the same training course, they don't emerge with 
mastery. Much more time is needed for ongoing coaching and 
applying all those skills.
Month-long onboarding 
bootcamps for new reps
Most companies are not hiring right now; in fact, many are doing the 
opposite as they lay off high proportions of their teams to cut costs.
Rolling out a new 
methodology
A methodology is key for any scaling sales team, but doing this well 
requires a heavy dose of change management and won't quickly solve 
the current problem.
Reliance on
superstar reps
As we see in the latest data, the number of superstar reps remaining 
at companies has drastically declined. Companies can no longer rely 
on just the superstars to carry them through a tough market. 
Breaking down the “normal” group and the underperforming group shows 
the true magnitude of this problem for revenue leaders. Within the “normal” 
cohort, it used to be that the top 20% of reps were the high performers—the 
superstars. In 2023, that number decreased to 4%. On the other end of the 
spectrum, within the 68% of underperformers, it used to be that the bottom 
10% of the team were the lowest performers—those nowhere close to meeting 
quota and unlikely to do so even with time and proper training. In 2023, that 
number has increased to 28%.
Why Existing Solutions Are Not Working
Historically, companies have relied on traditional strategies like those listed 
below. However, in the current market, these strategies are no longer effective. 
The following analysis will provide clear insights into why.
Why existing solutions are not working.TABLE F1

How We Fix This
GTM teams need a solution that drives Impact quickly—within 60 to 90 days. The 
answer lies with the 40% of the team sitting just below the “normal” performance 
line. 
This "swing group" can quickly succeed provided they are given focused support. 
With the proper training, coaching, and structure, the right approach can help 
them swing over the performance line and into acceptable performance levels. 
Revenue leaders can lift this 40% group to ”normal” using a "sprint." This concept, 
inspired by agile software development methodologies, applies training more 
surgically. Instead of introducing several skills simultaneously, the "sprint" 
focuses on just one skill, with a speciﬁc and measurable goal aligned to it. Unlike 
traditional training programs, this approach bridges the gap between learning 
and application by focusing solely on the practical application of a single, 
prioritized skill.

Moving Ahead 
Once you've rolled out the ﬁrst Impact Sprint, introduce the next sprint in 60–90 
days. And the next one, and the next one. This system provides focus and 
continuous improvement. Remember that the ﬁrst sprint doesn't need to make a 
massive impact—this is about getting the entire time into a cadence of ongoing 
improvement over time, working toward a clear and speciﬁc goal.
Solving for underperformance means shifting the training structure to a 
sprint-based approach. By focusing on one speciﬁc prioritized skill at a time with 
a focused training session and ongoing coaching, revenue leaders can elevate 
the performance of their employees—notably the ~40% and largest cohort of 
their team with the most signiﬁcant potential for quick improvement. Run a 
sprint, then run the next one, and the next. Lift up your underperformers with 
targeted support and a maniacal focus on impact. This is a repeatable method 
you can use to achieve results where it matters and drive more durable revenue 
growth. 
The Effect on Your Revenue
Calculate for yourself the impact this approach can have on your revenue:
● Estimate the number of reps in your top, middle, and bottom performer 
cohorts. You may instinctively know where each rep falls without looking at 
the exact data; take a guess if you don't have easy access to precise data.

● Enter your average rep quota and quota attainment.
● Calculate your current (approximate) revenue by cohort.
● Apply 1.53x improvement for the middle performer cohort. This is the    
result that can be achieved by lifting up the performance of this cohort. 
The example below was used as a template to calculate the expected results  for 
a team of 100 reps, each with an annual quota of $1,000,000, and the effects of 
implementing an Impact Sprint that boosts performance by a factor of 1½.

 $61,200,000 $73,920,000
In summary, this research offers a critical lens on the persistent 
underperformance plaguing SaaS sales teams. While the traditional methods 
of training and reliance on top-performing sales reps have proven ineffective, 
a more agile and focused approach—Impact Sprints—emerges as a viable 
solution. These short, intensive training cycles prioritize one skill at a time, 
offering a way to swiftly uplift the performance of the middle 40% of sales reps, 
those most ripe for improvement. By embracing this innovative training 
approach, companies not only stand to substantially enhance their sales ﬁgures 
within a short period of time, but they will also instill a culture of continuous 
improvement that promises sustainable revenue growth.

ANNEX G. PILLARS OF A COACHING CULTURE
For years, GTM management has been driven by a desire to achieve better 
results. We’ve been implementing the same management tactics, motivating 
people with money and fear, trying to manage outcomes with deal reviews, 
and forecasting—and then we wonder why we struggle to deliver consistent 
results. When we look at high performers in other ﬁelds like sports, the military, 
arts, and academia, what becomes clear is that success does not come 
from talent alone.
Success Comes From Deliberate Practice 
With a deﬁned process and accountability, combined with caring about the 
individual and building trust through candid conversations, we can achieve 
amazing results for GTM professionals, on both an individual and a team level. 
Start coaching by building a culture of learning and development. Provide GTM 
professionals with the tools, processes, and environment to make the diﬃcult 
behavioral changes required to succeed in the ever-evolving world of GTM. 
The fastest way to improve is by eliminating your weaknesses rather than 
optimizing your strengths.
Becoming a coach with a selﬂess style of management will give you the skills to 
enable your team and empower them to succeed. As a coach, you will lead your 
team by teaching them why each goal is set, which skills it will take to achieve 
those goals, and how to build those skills.
The Six Pillars: Building a Robust Coaching Culture
There are 6 pillars that act as the foundation of any coaching culture. From 
setting meaningful goals to understanding the science of adult learning to 
fostering a culture of accountability, these pillars are designed to make 
coaching an integral part of your GTM organization's DNA. They help create 
an environment of continuous learning, accountability, and performance 
improvement.

Pillar 1. Establishing Goals
Pillar 2. Coaching Framework
Pillar 3. Learning Science
Pillar 4. Coaching Cadence
Pillar 5. Turn-by-Turn Directions
Pillar 6. Consistent Commitment and Accountability
Together, these 6 pillars provide the basis for a culture of coaching that 
empowers GTM professionals to not only meet but exceed expectations, 
both for themselves and the organization they are part of.
Pillar 1: Establishing Goals – Starting With “Why”
Asking “why” will help your team members understand the long term by aligning 
their personal motivations with business motivations. GTM can be a challenging 
pursuit, with many obstacles and objections along the way. As a manager, you 
may need to help your GTM professionals articulate their personal motivations 
so they have a clear understanding of what they’re working towards and why.
Pillar 2: Coaching Framework – REKS
Along with clear goals, we need to create a clear path to success—one that isn’t 
just looking at the end goal but all the elements required to achieve these goals. 
Use the REKS framework below to visualize that path and provide a framework 
for collaborating with your team. Everyone should agree to clear coaching 
principles, like how you should communicate with each other if goals are missed 
or achieved and whether skills are present or not being implemented.
● Results: The speciﬁc and measurable outcome of efforts. Depending on 
the role, these can include discovery calls, meetings, opportunities created, 
deals/revenue closed, QBR/Impact Review calls, or renewal conversations.
● Effort: The deﬁned speciﬁc and measurable activities that lead to the results 
required. This can include calls made, emails sent, social messages sent, 
events attended, leads converted, or any other input activities that are 
leading indicators of results.
506

## Page 507

A N N E X
● Knowledge: The formal knowledge required, such as that of myriad GTM 
processes, product knowledge, persona proﬁles, industry context, and 
recognition of compelling events that are a catalyst for your product.
● Skills: The core skills necessary to execute on that knowledge. This can 
include the ability to run a discovery call, run an effective demo, handle 
objections, write a compelling email, or trade during the close phase.
Using REKS: Managers Focus on Results, Coaches Build Skills
In the REKS framework, a manager's primary focus is on “Results” and “Effort” 
because these directly impact the company's bottom line. The manager ensures 
that speciﬁc, measurable outcomes are achieved and that there is a consistent 
level of activity or effort leading to those results. In essence, the manager is 
primarily concerned with how the team's actions contribute to the organizational 
goals, and the company is the chief benefactor of this focus.
Conversely, a coach is more oriented towards the “Knowledge” and “Skills” 
components of REKS. The emphasis is on the personal development of the team 
members. The coach invests in improving an individual's understanding of the 
various GTM processes, industry nuances, and critical skills like objection 
handling or effective communication. As a result, the individual team member 
becomes the main benefactor, gaining expertise and abilities that contribute to 
their long-term career growth. While managers and coaches both play crucial 
roles in an organization, their focus and beneﬁciaries differ. A manager is 
outcome-centric, aiming to beneﬁt the company, whereas a coach is

Pillar 3: Learning Science
The traditional learning framework is broken. Adults don’t learn best from 
lectures, and one-time onboarding courses don’t stick. In contrast to what most 
of us have been led to believe, science shows that only 10% of learning happens 
in a formal setting like classrooms, videos, and books, while 20% happens 
through observing peers, and 70% comes from actually doing the work.

COACHING
Adult learning science has shown us the importance of on-the-job learning. 
Without structure, this crucial learning opportunity is lost, which is why creating 
a coaching cadence is essential.
The 10:20:70 learning model.FIGURE G1
Pillar 4: Coaching Cadence
There are 2 main elements of coaching:
● Performance (or traditional) management
Traditional 1:1 relationships are manager-focused, drilling into the forecast 
and past results, while looking to help on speciﬁc deals that “move the 
needle.” This is all focused on the goals of the manager, not the goals of the 
sales professional.
Instead, a coaching cadence provides opportunities to identify the sales 
professional’s “why,” understand any gaps in their knowledge and skills, and 
help them to conduct the actions to make improvements and achieve 
results. Manager-led cadences should include 1:1s, team stand-ups, territory 
planning, personal goal setting, and career development.
● Development sessions
In development sessions, managers should act as a coach to empower their 
team to contribute to a sales team-driven, continuous coaching culture.

Many managers see themselves and their L&D team as the bastions of 
knowledge for their sales professionals, but this creates a bottleneck in their 
sales team’s development and misses out on peer-led learning opportunities. 
To harness the 10:20:70 principle of learning science, you must create a 
structured, safe environment for sales professionals to share feedback and 
learn from each other and you by practicing their skills.
Pillar 5: Provide Turn-by-Turn Directions
As we master new skills, it’s important to understand the foundation those skills 
are based upon. Having sales professionals memorize scripts for complex 
conversations is not a good long-term strategy. 
By providing turn-by-turn directions, you’re arming your team with frameworks 
that apply to many different situations. They can use these to continue to guide 
themselves each time, instead of being stuck with what worked one time, only to 
fall behind when the world changes or something unusual happens during an 
interaction.

Although every customer conversation is different, there are common 
characteristics that are clear indicators of a successful interaction through any 
style of communication (e.g., email, phone call, or in-person).
Without a blueprint, many coaching conversations are guided by the coach’s 
previous experience, making the feedback subjective and unactionable. By 
working from a blueprint, both sales professionals and managers can provide 
objective feedback, free from prejudice and ego. This turns a previously “artful” 
process into something scientiﬁc and data-driven.
The Dunning-Kruger Effect
Coaching is critical to improvement. The Dunning-Kruger Effect, ﬁrst published in 
1999, suggests that poor performers are not able to recognize shortcomings in 
their performance because of their inability to recognize nuance like a true 
expert. In fact, amateurs are often more conﬁdent than experts in their ability to 
perform a given task. For example, over 80% of drivers self-categorize as “above 
average” when statistically this is impossible. A blueprint is an example of the 
fundamental skills that go into a framework, along with some clarity on why the 
framework exists and what you can do to improve upon it.

All professionals are susceptible to the Dunning-Kruger Effect. As one becomes 
more experienced and competent at a given task, their wisdom usually leads to 
the realization that there is more to learn—even things they don’t know that they 
don’t know. The best way to avoid overestimating your ability is by having an 
expert review your work, in real time or through video recording, and getting 
structural feedback based on a repeatable process.
Pillar 6: Consistent Commitment and Accountability
The biggest barrier to having an impactful conversation is the lack of a safe 
environment where sales professionals and managers can provide the feedback 
required to improve performance. Feedback should be honest, transparent, and 
delivered in a professional manner that doesn’t feel like an attack. This builds 
trust and requires a thoughtful approach where both parties feel respected and 
invested. Leveraging blueprints to enable feedback that’s focused on process 
and execution, rather than subjective experience, can rapidly accelerate the 
adoption of a coaching culture. Trust is something that is earned over time by 
consistently completing your commitments—for example, by arriving on time 
and prepared for 1:1s and coaching sessions.
Conclusion: Transform to GTM Through a Culture of Coaching
In today's dynamic and ever-evolving landscape, traditional management 
practices are no longer suﬃcient for achieving consistent results. This 6 
pillar framework is aimed at building a robust coaching culture within GTM 
organizations. These pillars serve as cornerstones that encourage continuous 
learning, align motivations, and foster accountability. By adopting these 
foundational elements, managers can shift from a transactional focus to a 
transformational one and move beyond mere outcome management to actually 
equip sales professionals with the skills, mindset, and environment they need for 
long-term success. In doing so, we not only elevate individual performance, we 
create a culture where continuous improvement becomes an organizational 
habit. Adopting these 6 pillars leads to more effective GTM teams, but it also 
contributes to individual and organizational growth, which sets the stage for 
sustainable success in an increasingly complex environment.

One of the ﬁrst skills taught to all salespeople is qualiﬁcation. It involves 
determining whether a person representing a company with speciﬁc 
characteristics—such as size, market, and intent to purchase—qualiﬁes 
to continue in the sales process.
In the days when teams sold IBM mainframe computers, this approach made 
a lot of sense. Mainframes were scarce and in high demand, and selling them 
involved tens of thousands of dollars and the utilization of specialized resources 
like engineers and architects for integration into the customer's infrastructure. 
Sales teams used a deﬁned set of questions to gauge the customer's 
commitment and, based on their answers, decided whether the deal was a 
priority for the seller. 
In today's world, however, SaaS solutions can be integrated into a cloud platform 
with just a single click or by providing a login via email. Outdated qualiﬁcation 
methods designed for multimillion-dollar products do not apply to high-velocity 
sales, where the client has multiple options and budget constraints are generally 
not an issue.
Instead of qualiﬁcation, we recommend focusing on the fundamental skill 
of conversation to establish the impact the customer aims to achieve and to 
ascertain whether it's genuinely a priority for them. The framework for teaching 
these conversation skills is built on an easy-to-remember acronym: TALKER.

How to Have a Sincere Conversation
● (T)one of voice: Consider not just the tone when speaking on a call but also 
the use of emoticons in chats and emails. One key element to focus on is 
speed; for example, avoid talking too fast in person but aim to respond 
quickly in chat sessions.
● (A)sk questions: Master both closed- and open-ended questions, 
and learn to ask diagnostic questions, much like a doctor would.
● (L)isten actively: Tune into patterns in the customer's words, tone, 
and emotional state. Learn to recognize emotionally charged words.
● (K)eep accurate but brief notes: Differentiate between Situation, Pain, 
and Impact while identifying causality.
● (E)laborate: Follow the conversation thread, teasing out both Pain 
and Impact.
● (R)epeat: Echo what you've heard to show that you're paying attention 
and to ensure you understand what is being said.

After such a conversation, you should clearly understand whether and how 
your product can impact the customer's business. More importantly, you 
probably managed the conversation to allow the customer to verbalize the 
problem and envision a potential solution for themselves. TALKER can be 
applied in various contexts to initiate conversations, from emails to phone 
calls to social interactions.
A conversation is a natural, human interaction. It connects you emotionally 
with the prospect and further allows you to uncover the real, pressing issues. 
It's the moment when a hypothesis about customer impact can be conﬁrmed 
or refuted by a trained professional.
